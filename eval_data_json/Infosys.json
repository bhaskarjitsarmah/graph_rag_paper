Good evening. Thanks for taking my question. So, Salil, two questions from my side. One on the harping on the guidance part again. I mean, for long, I think, the guidance that Infosys gives is kind of seen a benchmark for the industry and a lead across for the entire sector as well. And the sharp cut that we had at this time. So just wanted to understand, the putting on hold of discretionary spend and other issues that you mentioned that caused us to lower the guidance, do you see that as a very Infosys specific thing, or do you see it more of an industry across the board that maybe other companies are not seeing it right now, they might be following suit in the next few quarters. Or is it something in the nature of our portfolio because of which you probably feel that it was cyclical?"

However, there have\nbeen delays in the start of some of these programs and the decision-making in those.\nCoupled with that, we have also seen some of the volume during the quarter coming down because of clients\nin the industries that I mentioned, so financial services, asset management, payments, mortgages, telco, etc.,\nin those specific industries, reducing their volume of work.

Or there is an element of any hardware purchase along with it?

On this specific deal, what we have shared in the public domain is as per the filing with the stock exchange.

We do not have anything more to add to that comment.\n\nAbhishek Bhandari",

And then some of the mega deals and large deals, we saw a delay in decision-making in closing and also delay or changes in the start time or ramp-up of the profile of that deal. We have actually not seen any change in the win rate. And in fact, internally, we had a good win rate in Q1, and we continue to see good traction, whether it is consolidation, cost efficiency on the win rate side.\n\nAnkur Rudra\n\nAppreciate that. Just one clarification, if you could. I know this $2 bn framework agreement that you referenced is the second large deal. Could you clarify if this is fully contracted?

Last question if I can. On margins, they were obviously flattish this time, it seemed like you have done well given what the growth has been. The five-point margin maximization plan you have highlighted, is this you playing offense or defense on margins? In other words, is Infosys confident of potentially expanding margins in F '24?

We absolutely have the intensity in the client environment with a large and mega deal wins to be back into the growth mode that we have been in for the last several years.\n\nWe also have a high base for comps. Q1 of last year was a 21% growth year-on-year, in the previous year, whereas the environment of other peers were not there. So all of those factors coming into play, we are very much of the view that, we have what we need, and we are continuing to go into new areas, like, generative AI or continued investments in cloud to build out, what we want, what our clients are looking for, to continue with the growth situation.\n\nPrashant Kothari",

            "# Nilanjan Roy\n\nSo we look at this holistically. And we do not look at just one quarter and decide these decisions. We are looking at the overall environment and attrition, etc, and that is a decision we collectively take. It is just not on a quarter-to-quarter basis.\n\nWe have enough headroom in our utilization to grow volumes. And therefore, the attrition, which we see is not entirely replaced by lateral hiring. A part of that happens through lateral hiring, and we continue to re-skill and move up our fresher bench and rotate people through projects. So that benefit, we continue to get.\n\nAnd like I said, the 70 bps benefit, which we are seeing is coming partly because of improved utilization.\n---\nNitin Padmanabhan\n\nSure. And lastly, the $2.1 bn deal that we announced, in which vertical is that? If you could clarify that would be helpful?\n\nNilanjan Roy\n\nNo, we do not mention that on what vertical it is.\n\nNitin Padmanabhan\n\nOkay, sir. Thank you so much all the very best.\n\nNilanjan Roy\n\nThank you.\n\nModerator",
            "16\n---\nFinancial Services and the sub-segments there in telco, in some parts of retail, those being impacted in Europe as well, and we will see how that plays out into the future.\n\nMoshe Katri\n\nOkay. And my follow-up is about an article that came out this week in the local media in India, suggesting that there is an uptick in demand for lateral hires in the industry. And these hires will probably start happening in the month of October and on. Does that make sense to you versus what you are seeing out there in terms of demand and pipeline and the ramp up, that is kind of, as you said, it is going slower than expected?\n\nSalil Parekh\n\nSo for that, my sense is, again, some of the comments you might have heard earlier from Nilanjan, our utilization has gone up. Our total headcount number is reduced, and we believe, we have some headroom for the utilization to go up further. So that would be the context in which we are operating.\n\nMoshe Katri\n\nUnderstood. Thanks for the color.\n\nModerator",
            "Salil Parekh\n\nSo here, what we have seen is, again, in the industries, we referenced before, whether it is financial services or telco or hi-tech, the clients or the industries are going through a difficult environment themselves in the macro. They are looking for help or support from their partners like us, where they put some projects, which they perceive to be not immediately relevant for them on a pause or slowing. Those are the discretionary works that slow down. And we will see as the environment changes, what happens there.\n\nVibhor Singhal\n\nGot it. Great. Thanks for taking my question. And wish you all the best for the rest of the year.\n\nModerator\n\nThank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that would be our last question for today. I now hand the conference back to the management for their closing remarks. Thank you, and over to you.\n\n24\n---\nSalil Parekh",
            "Kumar Rakesh\n\nThanks for that.\n\nModerator\n\nThank you. The next question is from the line of James Friedman from Susquehanna. Please go ahead.\n\nJames Friedman\n\nHi, thank you. Salil, I think many investors are wondering, so I appreciate your thoughts. Does it seem to you that the soft demand was primarily due to macro factors, which are presumably temporary? Or is it potentially something more profound like perhaps related to the relevance of services or mindshare? So is this just macro it is going to go away, or is it a question of services in itself?\n\nSalil Parekh\n\nSo this is Salil. Thanks for the question. The way we see it today, we see this demand environment, especially on discretionary, that we have been discussing so far, as a function of the macro environment. We can see, for example, if you look at different industries, manufacturing growing at\n---\n21%, other industry is doing well, whereas financial service is weaker. So our service portfolio, we believe, works well."

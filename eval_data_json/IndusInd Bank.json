So firstly, on the slippages and the credit cost, credit cost is still at the upper end of the guidance.

            "Sumant Kathpalia:  So, if you look at the consumer finance book, the non-microfinance, it's about 14% to 15% of our book. If you look at the numbers, which are coming on that, we had a INR280 crores of flow, which happened on that business. And the recovery rates are also very high on that business. So, while the credit card is the largest flow element in that business. So, the credit card is 3% of our book. So, we should be able to maintain our credit cost. So, when we've done our end and within our calculations of 110 basis points to 130 basis points. We said 44% to 45% of our book will be corporate, which will become at 10 to 20 basis points of credit cost. The consumer bank will be around 150 basis points to 180 basis points of credit cost. If you look at microfinance, will be 250 basis points of credit cost. And our vehicle finance business will be at 100 basis points of credit cost. If you compute it, it will come to 120 basis points to 150 basis points to 120 basis points of credit cost.",

We said that our ECL will be in the range of 1% to 1.5% or 1% to 1.2% of the book. And I think that's what we are working on. It may be amortized over five years. We don't want to wait for it, and that's what we are working on.\n\nSaurabh Kumar: Okay. Got it. Thank you.\n\nModerator: Thank you.

            "Sumant Kathpalia: Adarsh, we have always said that margins will be between 4.2% to 4.3%. Don't forget, we have a book which is 45% corporate, 44% to 45% corporate book. On this book, you would see a margin suppression as because the MCLR or the EBLR will continue to change as we go forward. If they don't, you will start seeing the margin expansion. Otherwise, you will see what we've said, 4.2% to 4.3%. We are assuming that there will be a decline in the corporate yields as we move forward into quarter 3 and quarter 4. But yes, those will more or less be substituted by the gains, which we will get in the cost of deposits. So, in our opinion, our margins and if you look at six quarters in the presentation, we've been very stable and will continue to be stable in our margins."

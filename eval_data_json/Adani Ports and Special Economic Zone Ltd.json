So good to see strong set of numbers in the first quarter on volumes, but just on a longer guidance on 500 million tonnes in FY2025, now that most of the inorganic growth seems behind Krishnapatnam, Gangavaram, Karaikal, Haifa. Apart from Vizhinjam what else is maybe under evaluation or something in mind to help us get close to that kind of the 500 million tonne next fiscal.",

You would have seen the July number also reflects the similar sort of growth that we are continuing so we do not foresee any slowdown as of right now.\n\nAchal Lohade: So, in that case Karan how do we explain 370-390? If I simply analyze 100 million it crosses actually 400 million mark for FY2024.\n\nKaran Adani: Achal we cannot be changing the guidance on a quarterly basis, right? Some plus some minuses can happen, right. So, we continue to grow. So, we are optimistic at the right point in time we might like to change the guidance, but not at this point in time.\n\nAchal Lohade: Understood. Second question I had if you look at Krishnapatnam the margins have improved fairly significantly so can you help us understand the measures which are driving this margin improvement and the sustainability of this? Is there any one off in any of the other ports as well where the particular cargo or particular receipt is helping boosting the margins?",
            "Charanjit Singh: No, there is no one off in any of the port items at any places. It is a clear reflection of the volumes which you see. So, the port has recorded the highest ever quarterly volumes and that is the reason for improved margins.\n\nAchal Lohade: Understood. If I may ask, the impact of this cyclone, you said six days kind of impacted our capacity so is there any way to estimate what is the impact in terms of revenue loss or the margins?\n\nKaran Adani: We lost 2 million tonnes of handling volume because of the cyclone.\n\nPage 5 of 14\n---\n# Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Limited\n\nAugust 08, 2023\n\nAchal Lohade:  And would that be covered in this quarter or that has gone for good?\n\nKaran Adani:   Sorry covered meaning.\n\nAchal Lohade:  I mean effectively that gets pushed in the following days and the quarter so will this be covered or compensated in the second quarter volume?"

We have got the approval from the Maharashtra government and the land acquisition is under way right now. A lot of work to be done in terms of rejuvenating the existing jetties and the backup area, so we are working on that.

            "|Karan Adani:|So, this year's capex guidance already takes into account the 5 million square feet and for the remaining we would look at roughly Rs.1800 to 2000 per square feet as a ballpark figure to compute the capex.|\n|---|---|\n|Sumit Kishore:|My second question is also in logistics. Could you help disaggregate the logistics rail volumes of 131,420 into exim and domestic and basically what has been the here on volume growth? Is the exim imbalance situation expected to improve for rail container business in the balance fiscal?|\n|Karan Adani:|Roughly 90% of our volume is exim, 10% is domestic and we mainly run Mundra and Patli and Kila Raipur as the circuits and we have a very balanced route right now. We do not see any imbalance as an issue. In essence, we have actually seen more efficiencies coming in with the double stack counts increasing and especially with the DFC getting commissioned, we have seen the efficiency factors improving significantly.|"

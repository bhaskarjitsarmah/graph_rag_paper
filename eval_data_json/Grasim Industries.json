Please go ahead.\n\nSumangal Nevatia: My first question is on the viscose business. So, clearly costs are dictating. So, if you can give detail which all areas we are seeing cost dictation? And also, in the coming quarters as we can see prices are a bit of under pressure. What all some outlook on the cost for the coming quarters if you could share?",

So, all the important input prices have come down compared to last year significantly and also compared to the last quarter. So, that is a very positive trend. Looks like the input prices do not have much further room to go down, but we have to see. It all depends on the macro level situation and especially in China. So, China now is going through very difficult phase. Today newspapers everybody read that China is going through deflationary pressure. So, we have to see how the government and the Chinese economy perform in the coming months and that will determine the input prices all over the world.",

And also, on our as Mr. Agarwal was talking, the coal prices compared, we, I think are now buying. We have done better than the index values of the coal buying. So, our power cost mix is lower than the industry average.|\n|Nirav Jimudia:|So, sir, here if you can share what was our average power cost for Q1?

Yes, small things will keep moving, but that will not be very big.\n\nSumangal Nevatia: And so, the caustic business, sir, given the pressure on prices, coming quarter, should we expect margins also to trend in line with the price weakness or there are some offset available there?\n\nJayant Dua: So, this is Jayant Dua this side. So, we believe that caustic the way it is trending, you are nearly at the end phase of further reduction.

During the June '23 quarter, textile exports are lower by 10% Y-o-Y and 9% Q-o-Q, which has impacted the textile value chain from mills to garment manufacturers. The domestic demand for textiles and apparels is also exhibiting some sluggishness due to delayed festive season, which is in the later part of the year. Cotton prices have also declined 41% Y-o-Y and 4% Q-o-Q which to an extent impacts the demand for viscose as well.\n\nThe Chemical industry is witnessing similar global demand slow down impact, which has resulted in higher inventories.

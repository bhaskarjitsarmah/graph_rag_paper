        "answer":"The sustainable pickup in protection is being primarily driven by customer demand, particularly seen in HDFC Life web search activities. Additionally, there is a strategic focus on activating frontline sales across different regions with a tailored approach to product offerings. The company is aiming to enhance its retail protection segment by introducing return of premium products in Tier 2\/3 markets and emphasizing term products in larger markets. This growth strategy has enabled HDFC Life to consistently increase its market share over the years. The company's confidence in maintaining margins and expanding profitability is supported by the consistent product margins and the targeted growth trajectory they are pursuing.",

First, we see customer demand, which we believe will be sustainable. We see this demand in HDFC Life web search, which is happening in terms of protection.\n\nClearly, we are seeing a customer led demand. The second piece is that we are now looking at higher activation of our frontline sales across all geographies in a very calibrated and product-centric approach. What we are trying to do is trying to see whether we can have return of premium products in the Tier 2\/3 markets and whether we can have a better mix of term products in larger markets. Based on this, we have been trying to grow the overall retail protection.",

We were 12.5% in FY19, and we've reached 16.5% in FY23. That is the philosophy of triangulating and not wanting to lose our position in terms of ranking.\n\nThat hopefully answers your question as to why can't it be 30%. I can easily be at 30%. It is this triangulation wherein we will grow brick by brick. The pause was only because of tax. This year, we will come out with similar margins to last year, and next year, we will continue to move upwards.\n\nModerator: The next question is from the line of Adarsh from CLSA.\n\nAdarsh: Vibha, Congrats.

It's that the intrinsic product margins haven't really changed too much. The gap is in the growth that we aspire for, which is 15-17% number versus the 12% in Quarter 1. That is largely the differential in margin, which is something that we expect to even out as the year progresses.\n\nPrayesh Jain: Great. And on protection profitability - when you are getting into the lower tier towns, Tier 2\/3, would you say that it would be on a relatively lower side as compared to what you would be doing in the metros and Tier 1?\n\nVibha Padalkar: No. It is priced for all the risks that I mentioned to an earlier question, whether it is for slightly worse mortality or persistency levels.

        "ground_truth":"It is accretive but not hugely accretive. I would say that it gives more as a bulk than anything else. And it tends to be lumpy. You are in discussions for a long time with a particular corporate or PSU and then it comes through or they have shifted from one insurer to the other. So, it tends to be seasonal. It is good, but I would not read too much into it from a margin perspective.",

        "answer":"The recovery in margins in the second half can be attributed to the improvement in the non-par business, particularly due to the attractiveness of non-par products offering long-term guaranteed returns and a combination of guaranteed income and life cover, which has generated significant interest and uptake among customers.",

And on the segmental margins in the non-par?|\n|Niraj Shah:|Margins are fairly similar compared to what we've had in the past, adjusting for this gap in the growth that we spoke about earlier on the call. Our full year aspiration is to grow higher than what we have in Quarter 1. So adjusted for that, margins have been fairly similar given that nothing much has changed in terms of average ticket price.|\n| |At very high-ticket sizes, of course, volume has been impacted to some extent as expected, but it's been more than made up by the growth in the other ticket sizes where at an overall level, the average ticket size has been maintained for the segment.

            "extend that question, so when you say that the margins will improve in the second half, how much of the recovery in margins would you attribute to improvement in non-par business?\n\nVibha Padalkar: Even in April, I did allude that we believe that once the new tax regulations are socialized and digested, people will come around and see where else can they invest wherein they get long-term guaranteed returns. And there's really no other option that gives them a better deal than non-par products, and it's a one-stop shop of guaranteed income, which has caught the imagination of a lot of people and at the same time, also having a life cover. We have already seen the pickup.",
            "|Nischint Chawathe:|The second question is really on group savings and annuity and that proportion increased significantly this quarter. What kind of an impact it could probably have on the margins for you? Similarly, if you could comment on the segmental margins in the non-par business, given the fact that some of these products have to be repriced?|\n|---|---|\n|Vibha Padalkar:|On group savings, it is not hugely margin accretive. The reason we are in this business is more in terms of relationships and being in the market. By group savings, presumably you mean all the funds that we manage, group funds.|\n|Nischint Chawathe:|That is right.|",

        "answer":"The cost associated with HDFC Bank may not necessarily remain at the same levels due to the evolving relationship dynamics between the parent and child entities. The adjustments in costs could be influenced by various factors such as the type of customers served, profit margins, persistency rates, and mortality experiences. Discussions between the entities are ongoing, and changes in cost structures may occur as the relationship continues to develop.",

Now given the relationship changes between parent and child, then do we expect that the cost what we pay to HDFC Bank will still remain at those levels? Or it will broadly grow in line with the APE growth, that the channel will give us?\n\nVibha Padalkar:\n\nWe look at this as fully loaded cost. What the Bank has been able to give us is a very different category of customer. I think it is not quite right to say one particular distributor\u2019s costs are more. It is what margin does one make out of it. What is the persistency. Expense is one aspect, but mortality experience at the same expense is different. So, all of those assumptions will impact what the margin is.",

And it's not just driven because of the customer, but it's often driven within the Bank. There isn't one way, there are many ways.\n\nFor example, they could rightfully maybe place lesser people at the branch because I am of the school of thought that, learning from some of the other geographies, perhaps at Bancassurance, unbridled number of insurance people being deployed at branches is not optimal from any Bank's point of view.

            "Suresh Badami: That is right. Some of the players like PolicyBazaar are now moved from a web aggregator to a broking code. So they are reflected under the Broker channel.\n\nAdarsh: Got it. And my second question is, if you go back to the last call, what you have been saying is that because of the merger of the parent, the share you will end the year or you aspire to end the year at is 70% wallet share. This is a very big move from where we were last year. So obviously, you started moving in that direction this quarter, small changes in Q1, as you mentioned. What's the big change that will happen on ground for you? And do you see that playing out to up to 70%? Or it will be a little more gradual?\n\nSuresh Badami: I'll add on to what Vibha mentioned in the first answer to Suresh. We have seen a slight increase of 0.5% to 1% in terms of our market share increase at HDFC Bank. But to your point, I think it will be gradual because it is going to be calibrated both at the Bank level as well as at our level."

            "Adarsh: Got it. Thanks for the clarification. Just wanted to check, Vibha that 70% still remains an aspiration by the year-end or on-ground implementation can be a little more spaced out?\n\nVibha Padalkar: Yes. The 70% is not a number that we are articulating. It's up to the Bank and how they see it. It's not even been a month since the final consummation of the merger. The Bank will be in a new avatar of a conglomerate as against just the Bank. As that organically starts seeping in, the leadership at the Bank have said how we can upsell many things to the customer.\n\nIt is a strategy that will be led by the Bank as the parent. What Suresh alluded to are all the things that we are doing so that no stone is left unturned to meet them halfway and say that, we've earned our spur. We have done xyz things, and we have been efficient on conversion, on how we're handling complaints and so on.",

The second question that I had was that it seems like you're able to get about 100 million in synergies from the Exide acquisition.\n\nCould you talk about what more synergies could you extract from that business? How much more synergies are left to be coming from that business?

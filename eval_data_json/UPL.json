And then also just to check on the revised guidance for the full year. If I'm doing my math correctly, it seems to imply that in the second half of the financial year, the ask rate -- the implied growth rate would be probably north of 15% or so.\n\nAnd given that it will probably acquire 20% or 25% volume growth to achieve that given that pricing is probably going to be negative to the tune of at least 10 percentage points or thereabouts.

And you should also keep in mind that last year, that's financial year '22-'23, the Q4, we had a sharp dip in the prices. So, we do expect price correction to be lower in Q4. So overall, we do believe that based on what we are seeing and our assessment of Q2 as well as of H2, we feel comfortable with the guidance of revenue growth of 1% to 5%. And you're absolutely right. It will be largely driven by volume and to some extent by favourable exchange rate.\n\n# Abhijit Akella:",

I think volumes won't be nearly as impacted as they were in Q1.

            "Is the entire increase from $2.8 billion to $3.6 billion driven by working capital? And the other question is cash as well has sort of come down from March to now. So again, could you just help us a bit on the walk in net debt basically on a quarter-on-quarter basis? Is the entire thing working capital? And is it expected to reverse in Q4?\n\nAnand Vora: So, it certainly will get reversed in Q4 as I said, Q4 is when most of our cash collection happens. Also, as I mentioned earlier, about INR 8,000 crores of build-up was therein working capital. There have been certain investments and the tax and other payments too.\n\nBut as I mentioned earlier, we do see in fact, in the next two quarters also, you will see a slight increase in working capital. And in Q4, you will see the working capital coming down.\n\nSo that's been the trend over the last five years And as I said, in Q1, we have reduced net debt by about $160 million in U.S. dollar terms as well as we have reduced the factoring by about $250 million.",
            "Anand Vora: Sure. Thanks, Josefina. Due to the seasonality of our business, we do see an increase in working capital as we move into the financial year. So typically, you will see an increase in working capital in Q1 and it peaks in Q3. So, in December, the working capital is at its highest level. And then we see a drop in working capital in Q4. So, in continuation of the increase in working capital, you will see that the borrowings also keep going up. And therefore, we always compare net debt with corresponding quarter of the previous year rather than a quarter-on-quarter comparison.\n\nIn comparison to Q4FY23, this is almost an increase of INR 8,000 in working capital as we move into the season. And correspondingly, the debt has gone up. So that's the reason. It's nothing to do with our non-recourse factoring, which doesn't impact our borrowing.",
            "Moderator: We have a next question from the line of Josefina Rodriguez from Waha Capital.\n\nJosefina Rodriguez: Two questions from my side. So, I see gross debt you're reporting now $3.667 billion. In the last quarter, if I look at Q4 '23, it was $2.7 billion. So, I wonder if you are like now counting some maybe factoring or what was the driver of that increase in debt? Second question is capex. If you give guidance for this year and if you're thinking of maybe reducing it to preserve cash flow.",
            "Coming now to working capital; the working capital days increased by 14 days year-on-year to 122 days. This was primarily on account of lower payables and a reduction in factoring, as I spoke earlier. In rupee terms, the factoring was down by INR 1,700 crores versus last year. Overall, we expect to end the year with working capital of 65 to 70 days. To give you an update on the corporate realignment initiative, during the quarter, we transferred our Specialty Chemicals business to a wholly owned subsidiary, UPL Specialty Chemicals Limited. This proposed transfer has been approved at the shareholders' meeting in July, and the transaction is expected to be completed in the next few months."

So, it should not come as any surprise to them. So, the reduction in absolute debt by about $160 million as well as in terms of non-recourse, that's off-balance sheet reduction of $250 million, I think should auger very well in our discussions with the rating agencies.\n\n# Page 13 of 16\n---\n# UPL Limited\n\nJuly 31, 2023\n\nS.

So, can you highlight what is the situation in India in terms of our product portfolio and overall general industry perspective on the Indian market?",

Considering the industry where it is today, I think it's best to focus on profitability and conserve cash. So, we will look at reducing the debt.\n\nI also mentioned that we are closely monitoring the capex spend. So, for everything that\u2019s within our control, we'll try to see how we conserve cash. And needless to mention, we'll keep bringing down the debt as we move forward during this financial year.\n\nNitin Agarwal: And second, on the guidance given out, I think it's a pretty reasonably positive guidance for the full year in my view. What is the risk that you see to the new guidance number of 3% to 7% that you put out on the EBITDA?",
            "Michael Frank: Yes, Nitin. So, part of that goes back to how we're looking at overall our cost of doing business and so we really do think that on some of these AIs, specifically in the post-patent and herbicide market that these costs have reset. And therefore, we're also resetting our costs, both from a manufacturing and SG&A standpoint in those segments.\n\nAnd so, when we talk about taking cost out of the business in the range of $100 million over the next two years, it's really setting up our post-patent business to be leaner so that we can compete more aggressively. And so, I would say that's primarily how we're adjusting for this new reality.\n\nNitin Agarwal: And secondly on guidance from a year-end net debt perspective, do we have any color on what are we looking at in terms of reduction of debt versus the last year?

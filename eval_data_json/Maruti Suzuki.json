The second question that you asked about discounts. Discounts have been slightly up compared to last year. Last year discounts were at INR 12,748 per vehicle. Now it is at INR 16,214 per vehicle and also up from the quarter 4 of last year, quarter 4 was INR 13,269 per vehicle. I think with the semiconductor situation easing and with the mix becoming better, discounts should also progress. But you will have to see how the market behaves in a given quarter and accordingly, discounts would have to be maneuvered.

The wholesales in the quarter was about 420K, I am excluding the supplies and excluding exports, which means that the new order flow in the order would have been about 360-365. Is that the right number or were there a lot of cancellations from the opening book because of which the number looks understated?\n\n# Rahul Bharti:\n\nJust keep in mind that the Jimny and the Fronx are new models, so their bookings would also go up and of course the network stock has also improved a bit, earlier it was too low.

So, hopefully I think the realization should also improve as the mix improves in the next quarters. It (semiconductor situation) has eased a bit, but we will know exactly when we finish the second quarter in terms of where we are. But it seems to be better than where we were in the first quarter. That's the answer to the first question. Second on the commodities, now I think we have kind of stabilized. We will wait to see how the steel behaves. We had some uptick in the first quarter, but hopefully it should correct moving forward. So, we are seeing more stability both in commodities and FOREX during the year as compared to the volatility that we witnessed in the earlier years.

My second question is on the Invicto launch, just related to the Hycross and if we were to compare the similar situation on the Grand Vitara, I think on the Grand Vitara on the top end variants, we had chosen to price a little higher than the Toyota Hyryder, but on the Hycross, we've been able to put together a value offering which is priced a little more competitively than the top end sort of Hycross model. So, just trying to understand what were the things that went into that decision and how we were able to price more competitively than the Hycross in spite of manufacturing still being outsourced to Toyota?",

There would have been some challenges if we had not integrated them together, at least now the decisions would be far more agile.

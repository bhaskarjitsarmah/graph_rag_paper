            "Mahrukh Adajania: Okay. But that run rate should broadly continue, right? Because I thought Rs 500 crores of that Rs 2,000 crores will be upfronted sooner than the Rs 1,500 crores?\n\nPuneet Sharma: So Mahrukh, like I said, I think we said we will upfront some of the Rs 2,000 crores in the early four quarters. We are working to ensure that integration is smooth and is done in the fastest possible time. So directionally, yes, it's likely to be upfronted than back-ended. So your conclusion there qualitatively is correct. The Rs 2,000 crores number stands. The Rs 385 crores number for the quarter stands.\n\nMahrukh Adajania: Okay. Thanks. Sir, my next question is on deposit mobilization through the rest of the year, right? Some banks still have excess liquidity. A lot of banks have not grown deposits this quarter but it intensifies from next quarter. So how do\n\nPage 10 of 18\n---\n# Axis Bank Limited\n\nJuly 26, 2023\n\nyou view your deposit mobilization in the context of your margins from next quarter onwards?",
            "And the third element is, we\u2019ve added incremental staff in our growth businesses and technology teams. So therefore, there is an annualization impact of last year's, specifically quarter 4 hires and incremental hires in quarter 1 that is contributing to the balance staff cost. There is a marginal impact of gratuity that has played through given where interest rates have moved. But those would be the four broad components on basis of which staff cost has increased.\n\nNow on excess SLR, you made one comment and asked one question. My request is, I do not believe that between Amitabh or me, we said we will run through our excess SLR over the next six months. So I would just caveat your comment on the time frame. Our LCR numbers are 123%, gives us enough flexibility to grow our loan book as long as we get constructive opportunity. And as we reduce our LCR, excess LCRs will run off. We do not have a targeted guidance to run down excess SLR as a metric."

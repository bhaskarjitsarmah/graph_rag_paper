And that we had said is getting closer towards bottoming out. So, that's happened, and we are seeing some positive momentum there. The closure of the projects that we mentioned in Network Services within CME were more outside the top 10 customers, one probably closer to the top 20 and the other was even below that.

            "So, Dipesh, tactically speaking, while there are different customers who are at different points in time in terms of their transformation journeys where some projects for some people are still behind the curve, some have completed, and some are in the advanced stages. And I think it is too detailed to be able to articulate in a short while. But to answer your question, most of the trends that we see in terms of discretionary digital transformation spend as well as the cost transformation are pretty uniform across the major Tier-1 operators across the world. That said, while we are very well placed with many of these companies to continue to take advantage of their initiatives, we probably will go through some of these headwind days and quarters. The other aspect that played out this quarter like we said, were a couple of one-time cyclical issues that are part of our business. Hopefully. we'll be seeing all these behind us as we go forward from here. And maybe to provide a little bit more comprehensivity as a",
            "a couple of one-time cyclical issues that are part of our business. Hopefully. we'll be seeing all these behind us as we go forward from here. And maybe to provide a little bit more comprehensivity as a response to your question. I want to reiterate that the two areas where we saw a significant pushback was one is in the IT Digital domain and the other was in the Network Services where some of the re-prioritizations have happened. Geographically, I think it is pretty uniform at this point. I hope this was pretty elaborate for you."

        "ground_truth":"Inside the top 10 clients we were seeing some pressure in couple of our top customers in the last couple of quarters. And that we had said is getting closer towards bottoming out. So, that's happened, and we are seeing some positive momentum there. The closure of the projects that we mentioned in Network Services within CME were more outside the top 10 customers, one probably closer to the top 20 and the other was even below that. So, I think that's what is causing a reduction, which is leading to the decrease and then overall discretionary spend cut across the board beyond these couple of project closures which have one-time impact. Hence, you don't see that in the top 10, where it's more stabilized view now",

So, what gives you confidence that the growth may come back or this is kind of the bottom in terms of performance?",
        "answer":"The confidence in the growth potentially coming back or reaching the bottom in terms of performance stems from the cumulative impact of ongoing discussions with customers over the past few quarters. The revenue trajectory is influenced by short-term projects rolling off and discretionary cuts, but the company anticipates that the impact will not continue to decline quarter over quarter. Additionally, the company believes that most of the headwinds are now behind them, and while the industry is still cautious about capital outlays and operational expenses, there is an expectation of gradual progress and recovery moving forward.",

On the second one, it's a cumulative number from the discussion the customer had been ongoing for the last 3-4 quarters, right, and that's amount is a pile up of that, the quarterly revenues already in the Q1 baseline is impacted, so we've not taken that revenue, it's quarter over quarter, not going to have a decline or any impact to the year in terms of run rate, but it's a culmination of three, four quarters of impact. So, that's on the one-timer. And then in terms of communications, I would say, you're right, most of the headwind is behind us as we look forward. But in general, the telcos are still pretty tight on their budgets on any capital outlays of projects as well as on OPEX. The focus is a lot on over OPEX reduction. So, as we move forward, we'll continue to work closely with them to ensure that we align our strategy in making sure we help them drive more outcomes as they look forward to the rest",

I can't predict how soon things will ease out but where we have a good vantage point is from our funnel and our pipeline and the discussions both in terms of cost as well as opportunities. This is why I called it a perfect storm last quarter that maybe we've hit the worst, and we now need to start gradually inching forward. I\u2019m not saying all pressure points are over and done with, actually some of those we'll have to continue to deal with, it will be a gradual progress in terms of recovery for the industry and as a result for someone like us, but I think we will start making good progress from this quarter and definitely from the second half of the year.",

Several reasons why Tech Mahindra has faced one of its toughest quarters in recent times. My own personal belief is some of the transformative projects coming to an end, one odd customer declaring bankruptcy, a few challenges on the road and overall, the revenue drop and our cost, I mean we have not been able to balance it, right and which has become a prescription for a reasonably bad quarter in terms of our overall performance and I can only see an upside.\n\nReally three or four reasons why I think we have a decent upside:"

Please go ahead.\n\nRishi Jhunjhunwala: Just wanted to get some more color on our expectation of margin recovery over the next 12-15 months, especially if you look at from a headcount expense perspective, we are currently operating at 87% utilization, have seen a 10% headcount reduction in the last three quarters and our offshore mix also is pretty much at an all-time high. On the flip side, we are also talking about subcontracting, which would mean that subcontractors have to be replaced by permanent employees. So, effectively if we had any sort of growth coming back over the next 12 months, then our headcount growth has to be faster than your revenue growth. So, just trying to understand, I mean some of the levers that you talked about in terms of recovery beyond say the current blip that we have, what exactly will drive that specifically?",
            "So, Sandeep, maybe I'll take care first in terms of our action and then pass it on to Mohit for his views. But from an action perspective, when you look at where we are in terms of the opportunity, I think there are three, four areas that we've articulated before, which we will continue to execute. We've seen some improvement in these metrics, but I think there's more to be desired. So, if you look at subcon, our cost was 16% of revenue which we now move closer towards 14% and we said that we will continue to aspire and get towards less than 10% there, right. So, that continues to be a focus area as we move forward for the rest of the year. When we look at the Juniorization opportunities of our pyramid structure we've articulated that that's an area of improvement. As we go forward, we'll continue to invest in that and make sure we bring more juniors into the organization driving the more efficient average resource cost that will help us give more productivity as we move forward. We will continue to drive"

In terms of market share itself, significant improvements from where we started, but I would say we\u2019re in the mid to high single-digit range right now in overall cereals category.\n\nMasala oats actually, we have crossed I think, I would say, strong double-digit market share especially in places where we are present.

            "So if you move on to the next slide on stand-alone and consolidated, just the shape of the P&L. We are seeing revenue up by 12% in the stand-alone accounts, an improvement in EBITDA margin from 14.8% to 15.4% and PAT up by 23%. In the consolidated results, we've seen a 12% growth in revenue and an improvement in EBITDA margin by 0.8%. And if you look at the SEBI results, you'll see though material cost is marginally higher, we've optimized fixed costs and other expenses. So we're seeing a slightly improved gross margin as well as an overall improvement in EBITDA percentage.\n\nMoving on to PAT, INR359 crores versus INR277 crores, an increase of 30%. Group net profit after share of JV and associates lower at 22%. There is a loss compared to a flat number in the same period previous year because of a loss in the North India plantation arising out of weather conditions, lower crop and an element of lower realization as well. So that's the overall performance.",
            "Sunil D\u2019Souza: So effectively when I say innovation to sales, we take products which have been launched in the last 3 years. Again when I say product, changing of packaging, new graphics, new brand architecture, etcetera, doesn't qualify. It has to be distinctly new products per se or products which have been tweaked substantially. That's the number. When I do a benchmark with Indian food and beverage companies overall, about 4% to 5% puts us in the top quartile and that's why we had set a long-term target -- medium to long-term target of hitting 5%. It's good that we hit 5% in the first quarter. I would say I'm just keeping my fingers crossed that we continue at this level going forward.",
            "As we have said, we expect to see mid to high single-digit volume growth and a couple of points on price mix. We're still not there yet. Salt business, just to remind everyone, we took a 33% price increase in about 15 months. Despite that, we've seen a 5% volume growth which is good. But going forward given the fact that there is not going to be too much pricing, I think growth is going to be driven by volumes and premiumization.\n\nGrowth businesses have been delivering well up to 20% of our portfolio now. I think the standout is NourishCo, which has continued performing despite adverse weather conditions. Starbucks: Tata Starbucks recorded a strong quarter and now 348 stores. In the International business, pricing actions and structural interventions have led to sequential improvements in margin for 3 quarters now."
        ],
        "ground_truth":"So Abneesh, just as a perspective. The way we measure -- and there's a reason they\u2019re called growth businesses because we do think they've got a long runway. Just as a perspective today my business is highly tea and salt in India and we moved from almost single digit to about 20% right now. Just as a perspective, that 20% is also dependent on seasonality because NourishCo remember fires very well in summer and that's one of the reasons why it has hit 20% from 15% where it was same quarter last year.\nBut you're absolutely right, the margin profile on some of the Growth businesses is not where it needs to be. That said, it will improve with scale and as we fine-tune our entire offering there. What we do measure is a) growth rate; b) the fact that the growth rate is getting fueled by the right amount of A&P and distribution; and lastly, the contributory margin has to continue to improve because essentially the thesis is that these are; for example Soulfull, Sampann; these are riding on my base logistics and S&D platforms and there is not incremental fixed cost that we are incurring out there. So as long as the contribution margin moves in the right direction, I am adding incrementality to the business.",

In salt, is there a price cut which you have taken and would you see that there will be a requirement of price cuts there? Because you are still saying that the price hike will not happen, but you have not spoken on the price cut. And second, of course will be on the market share loss at the lower end, would you be worried because in tea we have seen earlier and we have also seen wherever sharp price hike happened and then deflation happened, regional players are coming back.\n\n# Sunil D\u2019Souza:",
            "# Sunil D\u2019Souza:\n\nSo Abneesh, the good and bad news is last year when everyone was facing inflation especially for businesses which were exposed to palm oil, crude, wheat or sunflower; we were not. In fact our tea prices were on a reverse trend. And therefore, we did not have as much of a price uplift in our portfolio. Right now what we are seeing is broadly flat to slightly marginal downtrend on tea. I would say right now we are braced for a flattish versus last year's sort of number, maybe slightly below, but that depends on how weather plays out especially in the north.\n\nOn salt itself, we would have expected the total cost to come down a bit because it's made up of 2 things: a, is imported coal, therefore coal, imported coal and the dollar prices and it is brine, which is sourced locally. Now dollar is stable, coal has come down a bit; but the catch is brine has seen a little bit of uptick given the recent cyclone which has happened in Gujarat.",
            "So broadly it is flattish, all these numbers put together. So we are not seeing cost movements and therefore we do not see price cuts happening for now and the reason I'm emphasizing for now is because tea prices we had thought will come down. We had not expected this heat wave in the north in April and May, which held up the tea prices. But if all things remain constant, tea we would start to see it coming down, which we have not till now, okay?\n\nAnd therefore, broadly we are playing in a flat cost environment and therefore no price cut anticipated. On the salt question itself, I wouldn't be too worried simply because I know I've\n\nPage 8 of 18\n---\n# Tata Consumer Products Limited\n\nJuly 27, 2023\n\ntaken a 33% price increase. The local players, which play even at a lower quality, there might have been a bit of swing. But I do think I have the ability to recover it very quickly once prices stabilize, which is what we are seeing now.",
            "Sunil D\u2019Souza: So the good news is that we had very clearly focused on building a strong procurement engine for ourselves on the non-tea commodity so to speak. And over the last about 12 months, I think we have started to get a few things right whether it is the upcycle or the downcycle which is happening in these commodities. And therefore, I see no reason to worry about. As commodity prices go up so will we take up prices and when they go down, we will also correct it. Overall margins, again the way we measure gross margins, contribution margins; they have gone up for Sampann overall and we are spending money behind brand building for Sampann which we had not for the past few years. So we do expect volume and revenue growth to happen."

            "Sunil D\u2019Souza: So the good news is that we had very clearly focused on building a strong procurement engine for ourselves on the non-tea commodity so to speak. And over the last about 12 months, I think we have started to get a few things right whether it is the upcycle or the downcycle which is happening in these commodities. And therefore, I see no reason to worry about. As commodity prices go up so will we take up prices and when they go down, we will also correct it. Overall margins, again the way we measure gross margins, contribution margins; they have gone up for Sampann overall and we are spending money behind brand building for Sampann which we had not for the past few years. So we do expect volume and revenue growth to happen."

        "answer":"The growth of NourishCo is primarily being driven by both distribution expansion and product innovation. The company has focused on introducing differentiated products that can be scaled up through geographic expansion. The strategy involves reaching a significant portion of the country with affordable price points, limiting distribution to around 150-200 kilometers due to freight costs. This approach combines expanding the product portfolio with reaching more regions efficiently to drive growth.",

The next question is from the line of Namant Satiya from Mirae Asset.\n\nNamant Satiya: My first question is on the NourishCo business so that's almost INR300 crores this quarter. Can you discuss what's driving this growth and the kind of scale you expect for this business 2 to 3 years down the line?\n\nSunil D\u2019Souza: So Namant, essentially again the hypothesis in the NourishCo business was that great differentiated products, which could be scaled up significantly both with geographic expansion and portfolio expansion. So both geography and portfolio expansion is at play. I would say we are broadly in about 75%, 80% of the country in terms of production right now. Again hypothesis being that we will not drive more than 150 kilometers, 200 kilometers with these products because we play at affordable price points and therefore, freight is a very, very significant factor.",
            "Arnab Mitra: Okay. My second question, Sunil, was on NourishCo's business model. Essentially that in most consumer businesses, you have a gross margin when you're building it up and then you have high ad spends, which there is operating leverage on. But just wanted to understand in NourishCo, is the advertising spend angle much lesser and it's more of feet on street and incremental distribution that you have to build, in which case that variable cost will continue to go up as you ramp up the distribution? That's the first part. And the second part was within the geographies you are present, what would be your like distribution versus, let's say, the market's distribution of water or other beverages?",

And also how is the profitability scenario in next couple of years considering we are going to have a scale? As per my understanding, currently we have a higher single-digit margin in NourishCo. So when we can reach a double-digit margin?"

We are still yet to build up distribution completely in Bombay, in Bangalore or Delhi. I mean we are picking and choosing where we want to play where we can get the fastest dime for the buck if I may speak so. But you're absolutely right. We still got a long way to go on distribution. But I would say in the near to medium term, we will complete the distribution gap and then it will be a game of 2 things: a, is building out strength in the outlets per se and expanding portfolio. On both these things, we've got a healthy pipeline lined up and therefore, we remain confident of continuing to deliver strong numbers in NourishCo.",

Remain cautiously optimistic. While rural has started to come back, while the north has started to come back; I'm keeping my fingers crossed because 2 reasons. A, is still not pre-COVID trends and it's dependent on what happens with the whole monsoon\/El Nino effects. Global inflation has started to plateau. I think we are more or less done with pricing or little bit -- small bits here and there on pricing left to tackle. But category demand trends in our key international markets especially on the volume front are going to be key monitorables. Q1 '24 we delivered in line with our commitment, double-digit top line with EBITDA margin expansion.

Now if the trend continues, we do see a little bit of margin expansion happening on tea. But again I would take it probably not one month, one quarter at a time when moving this. Broadly tea margins have come back to the ballpark, but they're still not where they should be.

My question was when I see your broader gross margin and EBITDA margin profile, it's around 43% gross margin, EBITDA margin 15%. But when I see your market share for example in Soulfull say high single digit, it is not a market share which can make lot of money at the EBITDA front. So wanted to understand here how you're seeing this entire 20% of the India portfolio in terms of profitability metrics. Is there a good movement or still because new products are getting launched, at an overall this 20% level the EBITDA margins, etcetera, may not have had a significant improvement versus say 3 years back?\n\nPage 7 of 18\n---\n# Sunil D\u2019Souza:",

In the International business, however, I should mention that volumes have been soft and there has been an element of small share loss in the coffee business, but we expect that we will come back and overall market growth will improve in the coming quarters.\n\nSo that's it from my side.

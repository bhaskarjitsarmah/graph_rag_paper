So, let's just break it up in the elements. Now I made a mention that last quarter, essentially quarter 1, we took pricing of about 1%.

Now that exports have started to see some progress, led by Africa. and the fact that the model mix will have its own impact because of that. So how should, Dinesh, we look at profitability, which has been quite solid actually at these levels. So how should one look at profitability going forward for the company? And especially given that there will be EV volumes as well, which may not be that margin accretive or potentially negative margins. So how should one look at the profitability trajectory from here?\n\nDinesh Thapar: Yes, Pramod. So, let's look ahead. I think price versus cost, you just heard me mention that on the price versus cost equation, I think it's all right because commodity is not requiring us to look at pricing. Of course, we look at pricing, if at all, there are opportunities that come our way, given the competitive positioning.",

But yes, there could be a potential drag on mix coming in from our stated ambition and aspiration to grow the EV Chetak.\n\nAnd as exports and Boxers start to come back. So, there could be mix headwinds that we will see as we look forward. But we will also hope to see some amount of operating leverage that will come in, as business starts to build back. So, on balance, I'd say that the margin situation is something that we will need to continue to manage and look to delivering at these levels, whilst we navigate some amount of mix headwinds, but hoping that part of that gets managed through operating leverage, whilst we dynamically manage the price versus cost equation.",

So, if you see on a quarter-on-quarter basis, the margins have come off by about 200 bps. So, if you can first sort of help us understand the impact from various segments, like you said there was one negative mix impact and commodity cost as well, so if you can break it up into the similar segments which has led to this impact?\n\nAnd second is on the price hikes, any price hikes you have taken in the current quarter, in Q2 after the first quarter, which maybe should help the margins going ahead?"

I just wanted to understand what the percentage of electric vehicle of the sales is at present.

So, that's about 2% when you look at it in the context of about 1 million units that we sell per quarter, right?

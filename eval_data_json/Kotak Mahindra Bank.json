Does that view still hold or do you feel pricing competition is so intense that 20% or maybe close to 2x GDP might be difficult?\n\nJaimin Bhatt: Okay, let me just take that out. It is, quarter one generally has been a slower quarter, so if you look at pre IBPC and BRDS, we are still at 3 plus percent, 3.5% thereabouts. So to the extent of the fact that we've talked for the full year maintaining a loan growth number at about 1.5 to 2 times the nominal GDP growth, I think we are reasonably comfortable at this stage that we would be in that range.",
            "Uday Kotak: I wanted to add something here. This is Uday here. If you go back to 2011, when savings deposit rates were opened up, most of the strong entrenched incumbents did not change their rate. We went out and started a 6% savings deposit rate and sustained it with the higher pressure from 2011 to 2020. We were perceived as the potential disruptor.\n\nIn this period, we grew our savings franchise for a period of over nine years at 40% plus compounded CAGR. We believe that, we are looking at total cost of funds. We believe that, we have a strong position in the CASA, which we are quite confident, we will maintain at a reasonably high level versus the broad industry benchmark. So we are not worried about that in terms of absolute CASA percentages."

The next question is from the line of Param Subramaniam from Nomura. Please go ahead.\n\nParam Subramaniam: Yes, hi, thanks for taking my question. My question is on the cost of the term deposits. So you provide us the cost of savings accounts. Now, if I try and impute from that, the cost of term deposits, it seems to indicate that, from the bottom of first quarter last year, it seems to be up about 200 basis points. So is that rough number correct? And does that mean that, there is not much incremental re-pricing that is to happen on the term deposit book? That's my first question.",

And while my colleagues will take you through a number of developments, there are two important developments which stand out for me to share with you.\n\nThe first is a very significant lever in terms of our deposits growth. Our deposits have really picked up and are growing at a very good pace, driven by a product which we think is, again, bold and disruptive in this marketplace, which we call as \u2018ActivMoney\u2019. And this product for us, just in this quarter, has grown at a flat rate of 24%, which would make it annualize nearly 100% growth on an annualized basis.\n\nAnd it's a unique product which is now about 7% to 8% of our total funds or total deposits and it positions itself beautifully from the point of view of cost of funds\n\nPage 4 of 22\n---\n# Kotak Mahindra Bank Limited\n\nJuly 22, 2023",

        "answer":"The attrition rate has increased significantly over the last two years, with the highest rate seen in junior management roles, particularly in sales, service, call centers, and collections. This increase can be attributed to various factors such as employees reevaluating their career choices post-COVID, industry-wide demand-supply imbalances, and the inclusion of probationary officers in the attrition calculation. To address this, the company is implementing initiatives focused on improving working conditions, enhancing engagement, providing better training, benchmarking, and leveraging technology for automation to mitigate the impact on operations.",

So if you see the breakup of the attrition, and I just want to quote some numbers, at the senior management level, it's around 10%, at the middle management level, it's less than 20%. It's only in the junior management, which is really at about 50%, which is what our disclosure is. And this is largely in sales, service and call center, some amount in collections. Now this has had several reasons.\n\nFirstly, this was the first full year post COVID, where people have decided their calls as far as their careers are concerned and we have had some spillover of attrition this year. At the industry level, there is a strong demand supply gap, which continues. Despite that, we were able to fully resource our requirements despite the gap and the attrition.",

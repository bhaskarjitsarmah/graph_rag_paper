Given you have a high participation in some of the cost takeout deals, maybe on the cloud side, is this showing up in discussions as a source of price deflation that maybe you or competitors are driving and hence might impact your contract profitability going forward?\n\n# C. Vijayakumar:\n\nSo, Ankur, at this point, most of the conversations on Gen AI are more innovation-led and we have not seen, I mean, obviously customers are always challenging us to demonstrate the art of the possible. And at this point, I don't see anyone trying to take the contractual position of how much we have to deliver through this technology because there are too many dependencies. So I think, there is definitely a lot of hype in the short run, but we do believe it will have some meaningful benefits in the long run.",

That's the final question on profitability. Prateek, what is the kind of a tailwind that you'll get from profitability through possibly, change in the compensation revision cycle for this year?",

And I do believe, it will get offset with so many projects in a few weeks, you have 140 projects, some of them pilots, some of them implementation, some of the examples that I shared earlier as well. So, I think there is going to be a little more uptake on small projects, which are really looking at proof of concepts and some implementation. And maybe gradually as it matures, there's going to be some more focus on how much efficiency it can drive.

Within that, the Software segment revenue decline of about 11 odd million was offset by the one-time benefit in the intangible reversal that we got this quarter. And therefore, the margin on the software was pretty much flat year-on-year and quarter-to-quarter. The Services margin is what drove the decline. Services margin itself dropped by 120 basis points, which had an exchange impact of about 10 basis points.\n\nThe balance 110 bps was operational. Lower utilization contributed to about 36 basis points out of the 110. Travel and other one-time type of costs, which we have at the beginning of the year, contributed about 33 basis points.

As you said, it looks like the Tech and Telecom declines are more than just ER&D. So I wanted to check, are these over pretty much? Should we think these verticals will return to growth? That's the first and the second follow-up on the nature of ER&D work that you do versus pure-play ER&D firms. Most of the pure-play ER&D firms, I think haven't seen this sort of Q-o-Q decline and now you've seen this for two successive quarters. So just wanted some color on what led to this decline?\n\n# C. Vijayakumar\n\nRavi, it's our exposure to tech vertical, which is primarily, which has contributed to it, Tech and Telecom on the ER&D side. Maybe most others have exposure to some of the other industries. I cannot comment on others, but that's our kind of hypothesis. And maybe, Vijay, you can add a little bit more on this.\n\n# Vijay Guntur",
            "C. Vijayakumar: Ankur, as I said in my initial remark, while we expected the quarter to be soft, it came in lower than our own expectations. While all the large deals that we won, we really executed extremely well. They all ramped up. They've all delivered good revenue growth as you can see in both Life Sciences and Manufacturing verticals. And even in Financial services we've seen good growth. Tech and telecom is where we saw more drops than what we had expected and we were expecting some projects to go online, but towards the second half of the quarters, that did not happen. So we did have people, we were ready and they did not really move forward. There were a couple of instances, one Tech and Telecom. So it was disappointing for us to have that situation, which not only declined our revenue, but it also had a big impact on our margins.",
            "# Vijay Guntur\n\nYes, CVK. Certainly, our tech exposure is more, especially big tech and we've seen a lot of consolidation and rationalization of spend. I think, from what we see in the market, that consolidation and rationalization of spend is stabilizing now. We expect the deal pipeline that we are having now to convert. That's what we are seeing.\n\n# Moderator\n\nThank you. The next question is on the line of Surendra Goyal from Citigroup. Please go ahead.\n\n# Surendra Goyal\n\nYes, thanks, sir. CVK on ER&D, is the worst over? And should we expect it to be back into growth trajectory going forward?\n\n# C. Vijayakumar\n\nYes, Surendra, that's what we believe.\n\n# Moderator\n\nThank you.

Is this what you were anticipating given that you've maintained the guidance and also if you could characterize the enterprise tech spend environment, despite seasonality and the strong deal wins that you had in the past?",
            "Having said that, obviously this whole cycle, the way I'm seeing is - the discretionary spend is moderating and it is probably stabilizing at a certain level and the cost and efficiency led programs have to fill in the gap and create net incremental growth. We believe that the state has achieved in three of our verticals, Manufacturing, Financial services and Life Sciences. And the other verticals are a little bit lagging behind.\n\nSo we are also tracking the pipeline and the maturity of the pipeline a portion of the large cost efficiency deals. And they seem to be on track. While our booking has been soft, we think we will deliver a strong booking in Q2.\n\nAnd if I look at the revenue translation of the deals that we expect to sign in Q2, there is a certain nature which helps us get revenue quickly. So I think that's really what we're seeing. And it's really a new cycle that's evolving, which is really offsetting the moderation in discretionary spend with growth and efficiency led programs.",

So whenever we've given guidance in the last five years, we've delivered to it. So we believe, all the math behind it and all the judgment behind it is very robust.

CVK, first, just a clarification on the whole discussion about guidance. You mentioned about some large deal wins. Are you factoring in a quick scale-up in these deals?

If not, then what is your degree of confidence that the muted environment won't push out the ramp-up, as Kawal also asked?\n\nC. Vijayakumar: Mukul, I don't want to call out the very specifics about the nature of deals but given all what we have said in the last 10, 15 minutes, we should assume that the significant part of this advanced pipeline can convert into revenue relatively quicker than what you've seen in the last two, three large deals that we've done.",
            "But we have done the math, and we have done the numbers I shared and CVK shared on the pipeline are what is giving us that confidence, and the stage of the deals in the pipeline is what is making us stick with the guidance. Yes, the pipeline is one factor which we have penciled in. Things could go better, things could go worse. We obviously do a probability of timing, probability of winning, and all of those metrics that I'm sure everybody does. At this point in time, we still want to retain and we are confident, as CVK already said, that we will meet the guidance."

        "answer":"The slowdown in deposit mobilization during the quarter is primarily attributed to the typical sluggishness experienced in the first quarter. This period is historically known to have lower growth rates compared to other quarters. Despite this, there is still underlying demand present, and there are positive signs of traction in mortgage logins post-merger, indicating potential growth in loan disbursals.",

            "And two, I know that if I take you back a quarter or two ago, that it is not about one quarter, you should look at how extraordinarily it got built in March, and then we sustained it. That means we did not lose that over and then we built on top of that because it was not a small feat and at least INR50,000 crores came through in March quarter, more than what one would have envisaged and we kept that and we built on top of that. And particularly the retail, if you see, we built 38,000 in retail. Typically the first quarter, you see the current account going down and savings account to some extent moderates due to spend.",
            "Abhishek: Got it. The second question, Srini, is on deposits. Now the reason or the point I'm trying to get to is your incremental deposit market share requirement is roughly 25%. And if I look at a longer period acquisition rate, you're going at 20% incremental market share. So there's still a 5% gap. Now, incrementally, would you have to raise rates? Because you've kept your rates at or below competition mostly. But now you have this incremental requirement, right? And it can't just be fulfilled through your investments in branches? So how do you think about your rates on the TD side versus let's say, or going forward, and will that lead to stickier rates on your cost of funds and therefore some more pressure on NIM? How do you think about that?",

So, let me first touch the deposit growth aspect. So, I know quarterly there can be fluctuations, but your Q-o-Q standalone deposit growth was about\n\nPage 6 of 19\n---\nHDFC Bank Limited\n\nJuly 17, 2023\n\nINR30,000 crores, 1.6%.

            "Srinivasan Vaidyanathan: It is simply a quarterly, Rahul, I think in some other place I alluded too. First quarter is typically a very slow quarter. If you look at three, five years' time period at an aggregate level on loans too, little more than mid-single digit to somewhere little, mid to low double digit, that's the kind of first quarter contribution to the full year. So it is normally slow, but we still see a good amount of underlying demand, which is there. And even as we speak, you didn't ask about this, but as we speak now as this quarter has begun and moving on, the mortgages now post-merger, what we get anecdotally from various sources within our bank, and as we see some of the logins, it has to translate into full loan disbursals.\n\nThe mortgage logins are 20% on a combined basis, 20% more than what we have seen before.

But over a shorter time period, yes, somewhere we have done 15%, 16%, somewhere we have done 18%, 19%, but 17%, 18% is the kind of, our capacities are built and that is how we are gaining traction to be at that level from a consistency of growth point of view."

I think, in the previous, some time, one or two questions ago, I did hear from Kunal asking the same in terms of the merger cost. There will be, it would be something within range and manageable, the stamp duty cost and certain other costs that requires to effectuate the merger, we will be spending that, we have spent or we will be spending that, but it is all there all within reason and nothing out of the page in a big manner.\n\n# Rahul Jain:\n\nAnd apart from cost, there is nothing much that can spring up on account of\u2026\n\n# Srinivasan Vaidyanathan:\n\nNo. Apart from cost, there could be some capital assets that we will put in from an infrastructure point of view, and then over a period of time, it will depreciate certain assets for capacity building, but other than that, some costs will be incurred, but they are within reason and range.\n\nFair enough, very helpful.

We are in addition to organically building, we are in the market for all of those all the time.\n\n# Rahul Jain:\n\nGot it. Srini, just one last question if I can squeeze-in on the merger related costs. I mean, is there going to be any one-off that we should expect, any qualitative color that you can give around, as you move to consolidate the numbers between you and HDFC Limited for the second quarter or whatever, during the year?

You got the money, you can get more loans that you want, and you're able to leverage further.

        "answer":"The interest costs have increased by 15% this quarter. The bank mentioned that their time deposit pricing is closely aligned with peer benchmarks and they do not lead by price when it comes to attracting deposits. They have indicated a growth in time deposit penetration from 14% to 14.5%, but with more customers, the impact has been marginal.

            "Abhishek: Got it. The second question, Srini, is on deposits. Now the reason or the point I'm trying to get to is your incremental deposit market share requirement is roughly 25%. And if I look at a longer period acquisition rate, you're going at 20% incremental market share. So there's still a 5% gap. Now, incrementally, would you have to raise rates? Because you've kept your rates at or below competition mostly. But now you have this incremental requirement, right? And it can't just be fulfilled through your investments in branches? So how do you think about your rates on the TD side versus let's say, or going forward, and will that lead to stickier rates on your cost of funds and therefore some more pressure on NIM? How do you think about that?",

So can you help us understand where you are in terms of your term deposit rates on balance sheet versus incremental?\n\nAnd the second is -- basically on this, on the HDFC mortgage book. So fair to assume that in six months, this book completely moves out, moves into EBLR? These are two ones, thank you.\n\nSrinivasan Vaidyanathan: So second question I didn't understand. Mortgage book, what is this?\n\nSaurabh Kumar: This will all be repo-linked now. This is all EBLR-linked and HDFC Limited.",

We have seen that our penetration has been low at 14%. We moved that needle to 14.5% right now, but the denominator has also changed. We have more customers now. So while we have grown 29% last year, 26% in the recent quarter, still it has made a difference of only 50 basis points higher from a penetration. We have a long way to go.\n\nAnd if you look at the pricing, which is where you started this question, how far pricing is influenced by this, you can be any point in time, if you look at the pricing, our deposit, time deposit pricing was some of the peer benchmarks. If you see, they're pretty closely aligned. We don't lead by price. I want to leave the thought there. This is part of the ALCO discussion in terms of how we engage with the customer and how pricing is not the lead consideration for getting any deposits.",
            "Mahruk Adajania: Got it. And my next question is on loan growth and incremental deposit growth. So just in terms of loan growth, we had kind of indicated doubling of the book. Do we see that starting FY \u201824? Because the run rate is a bit softer in the first quarter. So the merge balance sheet has grown 13% after including everything and if you exclude IBPC then it's grown 16%. So do we -- can we see a 17%, 18% growth as we end the year?

But given how RBL financials are, it\nprobably will need capital infusion like 1 to 1.5 years down the line, which is sooner than the\ntimeline. So, is there a thought process that you will participate in that? Because right now\nyou've just, bought from the open market, so how should we think about that.\n\nAnish Shah:    Haven't thought about that but I would just say that we expect the bank to do well. There will\nbe multiple folks who want to come in on a rights issue and at that point we'll be, look, do we\nparticipate in a rights issue to maintain 3.53 or do we not participate, I think it'll depend on\nthat, but that's frankly going to be a very small amount.

Most of the core commodities are between 15% to 25% higher than they were in the 2019 time to now. So, the time when we are comparing our margin of 7.5% to 7.5% when we say it is benign, all the key commodities are still 15% to 20% higher, they've just come down from the one big peak that we saw a year back. They're way, way, way above the 2019 levels. So, again, back to the margin as a percentage topic. So, we've gone through BS6, we've gone through BS6.2, we've gone through a, let's say corrected averaged out say 16%-17% commodity inflation.

We\u2019ve spoken about that earlier in a segment in which we have a relatively lower presence and that\u2019s the orchard and the light weight tractor market, size of which is approximately 50,000 and our market segment market share there is 30%. With the launch of the Swaraj Target, which has already happened, and the OJA which will happen in the later part of this quarter, we see an upside for us in this segment and enabling us to increase overall tractor production. Anish spoke about farm machines. We're seeing good momentum. Clearly our aspirations for growth are higher and we should see that start coming in during the latter part of the year."

The approach is to give back surplus cash to investors if the capital cannot be effectively utilized to generate returns above industry standards. The decision on how to give back cash will be made once the EV plans are finalized. Currently, the company is focused on growth, which is why they have not done more in terms of dividends or buybacks.",

One is one of the important aspects of capital allocation is also giving back cash to shareholders, surplus cash to shareholders. What are your thoughts on dividends or potential buybacks, etc? That's one. A couple of questions on the SUV side. One is Rajesh, you mentioned the cancellation rate on bookings is about 8%. Is that a monthly number or a quarterly number or how should we look at it and 3rd on the SUV side again, how have retails clocked in,1Q wholesale were about 101. How were retails?

            "Anish Shah: So, first we've increased dividends significantly this year. I think about 40% or somewhere in the 35% to 40% range. And our approach is that if we cannot use capital effectively to be able to generate returns over and above what other industry participants would generate, we give it back to our investors. So, we will look at how we give it back in the best form if we have to. Right now, we're waiting for our EV plans to get completely finalized to make sure we've got enough buffers for that and if we have to then start giving back we will do it at that point in time. We are in a significant growth mode at this point, which is why we haven't done more than that so far. But despite that, I'd say close to a 40% increase in dividend is a pretty good start in that front.\n\nRajesh Jejurikar: Can you just repeat your second question?\n\nJoseph George: Second was the cancellation rate of 8%?",

And therefore, that further enhances our capital discipline because what I didn\u2019t talk a lot about earlier and again happy to do that more in the question and answer session. For us, as important as capital allocation is execution, if I look back in our past it wasn't that we invested in many international businesses. It was that they didn't work. If you had gotten great results from there, there would have been no questions on capital allocation. So, execution is most important for us as well, and that's what we will drive with the discipline, it's we've got to invest in the right areas and ensure we get the results that we say we will get when we invest in those areas."

So, basically there's a time to convert billing to retail because at the end of the day, a customer who was waiting for the vehicle when the vehicle is going to come has to arrange their cash, has to do their loan closure and has to pick a time and date which suits them for when they want their delivery.

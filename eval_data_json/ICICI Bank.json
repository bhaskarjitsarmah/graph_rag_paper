I think, we did get some benefit of the last repo hike, which happened during Q4, because the portfolio reprices over a period of time based on the reset date. So that benefit did come. There was also some benefit in the yield on investments, because of the repricing of some of the floating rate bond portfolio and so on. So, assuming that repo rate remains where it is, those kind of benefits will not be there in the subsequent quarters, that's correct.\n\n# Nitin Aggarwal:\n\nRight. And if I can squeeze in one more question.

And second question is, there has been a slight increase in our NIM advances this quarter, is it possible to share how much of this increase is due to the mix change and growth and how much is due to repricing of loans? What I'm trying to really assess is like, this quarter the NIM compression has been around 12%. So, in the absence of any repricing-related benefit, is it fair to say that NIM could see sharper decline in 2Q and 3Q, when the repricing could be at its peak?\n\n# Anindya Banerjee:",
            "# Anindya Banerjee:\n\nSo, this quarter, I think, if you look at it, we have seen some increase in our yield on investments and on our yield on advances. I think, we did get some benefit of the last repo hike, which happened during Q4, because the portfolio reprices over a period of time based on the reset date. So that benefit did come. There was also some benefit in the yield on investments, because of the repricing of some of the floating rate bond portfolio and so on. So, assuming that repo rate remains where it is, those kind of benefits will not be there in the subsequent quarters, that's correct.\n\n# Nitin Aggarwal:\n\nRight. And if I can squeeze in one more question. On the corporate lending piece, like, we have reported pretty strong growth, 19%, some of the peers this quarter have not grown citing the pricing pressures. So how do you view versus the competitive environment in wholesale business?\n\n# Anindya Banerjee:",
            "Moving on to the P&amp;L details:\n\n# C. P&amp;L details\n\nNet interest income increased by 38.0% year-on-year to 182.27 billion Rupees. The net interest margin was 4.78% in this quarter compared to 4.90% in the previous quarter and 4.01% in Q1 of last year. The sequential movement in NIM reflects the lagged impact of increase in deposit rates over the last year on cost of deposits, offset, in part, by an increase in loan and investment yields. Of the total domestic loans, interest rates on 46% are linked to the repo rate, 3% to other external benchmarks and 20% to MCLR and other older benchmarks. The balance 31% of loans have fixed interest rates. The impact of interest on income tax refund on net interest margin was 3 basis points in Q1 of this year compared to nil in the previous quarter and 3 basis points in Q1 of last year.",
            "So, actually, I think if you look back a little further, we were not growing till last year, our corporate loan portfolio as much, while some of the peers were growing it at a much faster clip and our main concern was around the levels of pricing. I would say, over the last year, possibly, certainly, there has been some improvement, post the monetary tightening cycle, there was some better opportunities for corporate\n---"

And also, given the increments and started the year at that level. So that is what has led to the increase in the employee cost. And from here on, we will see based on our\n---\nKunal Shah:\n\nSure. And one last question on MCLR differential to private banks. We are still much lower, almost like 25 to 45 basis points kind of there Any plans to catch up on that? Maybe, obviously, it's a factor of cost of deposits and the return expectations, but still it's much on the lower side. And should we see we're getting the benefit on the corporate when we do the lending, maybe clearly a pricing benefit vis-a-vis the private peers?\n\nAnindya Banerjee:",

If I look at the number that we reported in fourth quarter and strip out the brand divestment, based on that, we've seen a pretty sharp increase on that base in the first quarter. Did the trade generic -- I know we officially announced the launch in July.

Please go ahead.\n\nKunal Dhamesha: Congratulations on the good set of numbers. First, on the US revenue growth. So, on a sequential basis, we have seen a significant uptick as well. Would you be able to give us some colour as to which were the primary driver, was it the acquisition, was it the Lenalidomide uptake in order of their quantum, if you can provide, even qualitatively would be very helpful?\n\nErez Israeli: Yes. So, this quarter, we had several growth engines. So, it's not just Lenalidomide. We grew market share in key products. This was, let's say, more than previous quarters. We saw relatively less price erosion that we normally do. We had the Mayne acquisition that contribute to that, and Lena. So, it's a combination of all of them. Even without Lena, it was a very healthy growth in the US.",

So, it will be kind of a pickup of the brands. So, every one of these brands will take a few years before it will come to its peak sales.

That's my first question.\n\nErez Israeli: So it's a combination of timing of RFPs, combination of set of situation that happen to products in which we could supply more, not necessarily a supply shortage, but it could be service or other supply disruption situation that happens, and also activities that we did with certain customers as well.

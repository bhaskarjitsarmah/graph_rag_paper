            "|---|---|\n|Parikshit Kandpal:|My question was more on the securing equipment part. Like, the PNG project if there could be potential shortage of transformers, switchgears. The same way across your order book, there would be shortage in other segments. Are you seeing any trends where\u2026|\n|P. Ramakrishnan:|Okay. So Parikshit, I'm sorry to interrupt you. As it stands now, because if you see the run up of growth in the Infrastructure segment in revenues also, that doesn't seem to suggest that there is any shortage of equipment for execution or any materials shortage. So I guess, at this juncture, premature to comment that there is a possibility of Infrastructure equipment getting into an obstacle for execution.|\n|Parikshit Kandpal:|Okay. My second question is on IDPL now. So, can you highlight on what stage we are in terms of closures and most likely when we get approval, there's money coming in?|",
            "|Sanjay Kumar:|Okay. Okay. Got it. And second, can you talk about the orders in U.S. because U.S. is spending a lot on construction, which we are seeing in jobs data and even project announcements. But for us, U.S. and Europe country grew 15% to inflows in revenue, but less than 1% to backlog for the last 3 years. So it seems to be a short cycle order. So are we focusing there because what kind of orders are we in?|\n|---|---|\n|P. Ramakrishnan:|So Sanjay, what you see in U.S. and all, they are all reflecting nothing but the revenues of IT&TS portfolio, which has also put in order inflow. So as a EPC contractor, our order prospects pipeline currently does not undress any western world orders at this juncture.|\n|Sanjay Kumar:|Okay. And on Hi-tech manufacturing, sir?|",

Ramakrishnan:|So Parikshit, while I was giving you the order prospects pipeline where I also gave a split of the 5.85 prospect pipeline for Infrastructure segment for the balance 9 months. I also gave you a breakup ranging between Transportation Infrastructure, which is the highest to Minerals and Metals at 6%, which is the lowest across the entire 5 or 6 subsegments that we have. Once again, I wish to reiterate here that the actual set of opportunities that could come in these segments could be possibly even more higher, but we are mindful of the fact that today, the Infrastructure segment itself is having almost a 3 trillion order book for execution. So we are targeting the projects where we have the capacity to execute and also the competition intensity for such kind of a orders is a shade lower.|\n|---|---|"

I think, SNS has some time back said that they are targeting to be a top 5 player and Rs 10,000 crores is a target for presales by FY '25.

            "P. Ramakrishnan: So I think that once again, we had articulated quite in detail when we closed FY '23 in the month of May when we gave the guidance of 9% for Projects and Manufacturing with a clear qualifier that the first 6 months could be a little subdued on the back of a major part of the jobs\n---\n# Larsen & Toubro Limited\n\nJuly 25, 2023\n\nthat we have secured until 2020-21, which is COVID year and thereafter, when they went into execution, they had the additional brunt of higher commodity prices.\n\nSo a major part of these jobs should get completed in the first half or possibly definitely by Q3 of the current year. And it is basis this construct that we have given a guidance of 9% for the full year with a clear view that the first 6 months for Infra could be a little subdued.\n\nModerator: Next question is from the line of Ashish Shah from JM Financial Limited.",
            "P. Ramakrishnan: So Mohit, if you recall, when we did our earnings call for Q3 FY '23 in January, we still had a similar question. And as you know, that this year, we all are aware that the first 3 quarters for India could be really busy. And there is always a chance that because of the impending general elections, although the dates have not been announced, we have to be mindful of it. So we are taking into account this aspect. Although Q1 order inflow has been reasonably robust. But as you know, the ordering momentum can be a little lumpy sometimes. So let's see, as we get into Q2, Q3, I think we'll have a better visibility to talk about revising the guidance.",
            "As far as order inflows are concerned, we will still maintain that 10% to 12% trajectory. On the revenue execution part, we had given a guidance of 12% to 15% and I'm happy to say that the Q1 revenue growth has been reasonably good. But Q2, as far as the project is concerned, can have some impact because of the seasonal monsoon and all. Q2 will definitely at least give us a clear visibility in terms of the execution momentum that will flow into Q3, Q4 and maybe at that point of time we can have a better comfort on seeing whether we possibly can touch the on the higher side of the revenue guidance. But at this stage, it is premature to conclude. So we still maintain the band of 12 to 15 percent.\n\nMohit Kumar: Understood. And my second question is on the margins. The core margin Y-o-Y were weak. So when do you think the impact of the legacy projects will wear off? And are these orders before FY '21?"

It was an old order that was not moving, that was almost Rs 1,000 crores. The rest is all a combination of various orders which after the completion is no longer required, so they get deleted.\n\nRenu Baid: Got that. Thanks.\n\nModerator: Thank you. Next question is from the line of Sumit Kishore from Axis Capital Limited. Please go ahead.\n\nSumit Kishore: Thank you so much PR.

The second question is while the defense prospects for the balance fiscal seem to have gone down as included in that number for Heavy engineering, Defense, and Green Energy EPC.

I don't know whether that is indicative of the way things happen in KSA, but what is changing at this point of time for us to be believing that the change in mindset over there is something that can lead to medium-term gains for us, which are more sustainable?\n\nP. Ramakrishnan:  So, when you talk about medium-term gains, I'm sure you're referring to margins. I did mention that Hydrocarbon margin has been consistently in that 9% to 10% band over the last two years or so. And with the kind of order book that we have across both India and outside India, I don't see any reason for us to comment upon whether there would be a significant upturn in margins or a downturn."

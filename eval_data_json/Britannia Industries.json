So could you elaborate on what exactly you have done in terms of several pricing initiatives? And in case you have passed on gramage back to customer, when do you see the volume trajectory benefiting because of that?\n\nBecause if you have passed on grain, why is the volume still flattish? And related question to this is when I see the market share data which you have given? Number 2 the player has lost significant market share, but that benefit does not seem to have come to us. You have also lost, I think, a big market share. So is this data credible? And if it is credible, who has gained the market share?",

Rusk, again, we've strengthened our portfolio with regional core flavors like butter Rusk, which is yeast dominated product. And our local competitor had a large play in that.

Should we believe that unless the commodity prices change versus the current levels, the margins that you have currently sort of done are a good representative of what should continue in the future? Or do you think that it could drop further because you might take further price cuts? I mean how should I approach this? I'm not looking for a number guidance, but more of guidance on how to think about this?\n\nVarun Berry: No. So the way to think about it, the way I think about it is that the priority for us, we are reasonably profitable. I think we are -- our margins are very robust and healthy. The trick is growing our top line and making sure that we get the volumes and the shares which are required, and with that will come the margins. Okay.\n\nPercy Panthaki: So it is possible that in the near term, the margins might go below what we have seen this quarter. Am I reading that right?",

So you mentioned you probably need to take some more price corrections. And our understanding is there is a bit of a sequential up move we are seeing in edible oil, sugar, and possibly even in wheat flour. So in this environment, do you not feel that there could be more pressure in margins in the near term? Or are there other ways you could offset this situation?",
            "So on an outlook basis, we are very vigilant on competitive pricing actions. We are also closely monitoring the stock price situation of commodities. And finally, we are employing the necessary pricing strategies which would be deployed to remain competitive and drive market share as well as drive profitable growth in the future.\n\nSo as a result of that, our numbers for the quarter have been very healthy. We've -- if you go to Slide number 17, we've had -- on the top line, we've had a 12-month growth of 9% and a 24-month growth of 18%. And if you go to the next slide, our operating profit has grown in the 12 months at 37% and in the 24 months at 22%. So a fairly healthy and robust growth on both the top line as well as the bottom line.",
            "So moving on to Slide number 15. On the cost and profitability front, we've initiated pricing actions to stay competitive and drive market share. Now as I was saying on the last slide, some of the companies had not covered as well as we did last year. So their commodity prices were much higher than ours last year. So they have seen a deflation, which is much larger than what we've seen this year. And as a result of that, there's been quite a few price corrections, which have happened in the market."

If you look at our trajectory for many years, except for -- so if you look at it, if you look at '21, '22, we were at an average of about 14%, right, on operating profits. In Q1, we are at 15.6%. So what you are really looking at in the coin periods of high numbers. So whether it's 2021, and obviously, last year, we were taking price increases to make sure that we met our targets as far as inflation was concerned. So if you were to look at -- if you were to draw a line progression line, I think we are moving in the right direction, and I think that will continue.|",

So price reversals of 1.8%, fiscal benefits are because they were taken in Q4 and not in Q1. So that's 2.4%. There's an employee cost increase, which is flattish.

On sugar, there has been a slight inflation of 1% and versus last quarter, it's been an inflation of 2%. On laminates, again, there's been a deflation versus last year of 18% and versus last quarter of 3%, and similarly on corrugated boxes.

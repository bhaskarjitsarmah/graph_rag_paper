If you look at the kind of assets you're working on, while the dermatology assets are obviously complementary to your existing portfolio, but osteoarthritis or a diabetes asset, these are, again, assets for which you will actually have to take it to a very different set of physicians, probably at least in the US.

Let's say, the R&D spend, if I see, excluding of the specialty, it is remaining in the kind of a similar range and higher number itself. So -- whereas the filing of ANDAs, if we see for US, that has, to some extent, got moderated. So how should we see that? Is it right to think that -- now our focus is diversifying our strength, R&D capability and all for developing products for not only US market but all major markets, including India? And also, leveraging the products of the US could be the specialty products for other markets?\n\nDilip Shanghvi: I don't have exact response. But one of the reasons why I think the filing numbers that you see is lower is also because of the ransomware attack that we had seen. So since we were unable to retrieve the data of many of the products, it impacted our filing capability. So, as we are going back to normal, we should then be able to file those products."

So just wanted to understand what has led to sequential pickup for your base generic business, wheper it's good demand in channel or like improved supplies from your plants where we had some setback earlier. So a bit more of a clarity here will be helpful.\nDilip Shanghvi: Yes, Abhay, maybe you would like to respond.\nAbhay Gandhi: Yes, sure. Sure. Damayanti, I pink Mr. Murali, in his readout, has mentioned pis, pat we had significant sales of lenalidomide in pe quarter, and pat may be episodic going ahead. So in pe first quarter, pat was a significant contributor.\nDamayanti Kerai: Okay. But some of your peers are talking about improved channel demand, etc. Are you seeing a similar situation?",

So they inspect and approve all of those.\n\nModerator: The next question is from the line of Harsh Bhatia: from Bandhan Asset Management.\n\nHarsh Bhatia: Yes. Hope I'm audible.

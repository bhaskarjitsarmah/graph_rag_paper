The only reason for lower GRM addition on account of petrochemicals is that during this quarter \u2013 in fact the last couple of quarters \u2013 due to the lower demand of petrochemicals in China, the import parity prices have been on the lower side. We are expecting this trend will continue for a couple of quarters more. Once the Chinese economy revives and if the Chinese demand comes back and once the petrochemical prices go to the normal levels, definitely the margins of PDPP will go up.

Because we cannot give any exact numbers, I can give what percentage of crude our refineries can process because everything depends on what is the availability of Russian crude based on the timelines. For example, for X period of time, for example a particular month if I need some X cargoes; if available in the market, then I can take X cargoes and process. Many of the times, our requirement and market supply may not match. So, we cannot give exactly what would be the Russian crude we can process. But on an average directionally, we can take around 30% to 40% all three refineries put together, we can process Russian crude.\n\nVipulkumar A. Shah: But at least you can give what you have done in the last quarter? That is my point.\n\nVRK Gupta: I am giving the range. In this particular range, we can work on.\n\nVipulkumar A. Shah: And what was the discount?"

        "ground_truth":"Based on our experience, once the price is crossing beyond the threshold, we have faced a little bit payment issues earlier. Now we have to wait and see for the next cargoes when the payment dues are happening. At least for the time being, we are not foreseeing any problem because now more banks are ready for making the settlements. So, we have to wait and see. As of date, there are no payments which are pending for settlement. We have to wait and see. In case really if there is any purchase price beyond the price cap, see if there are any issues or not.",

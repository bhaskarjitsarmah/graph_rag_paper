Last year, it was, I think, 47% new buyer contribution for the quarter, and this year, it's 46%. So yes, repeat buyers have grown at a faster rate than new buyers, but the percentage difference is only 1%. I wouldn't compare it to Quarter 4 because there is a seasonality element in whatever we do.\n\nAnd grammage growth, etcetera, is good, but actually grammage growth is not an operating KPI that management actually tracks very, very actively. We are aware of it. But for us, volume is driven largely on buyer growth. And within that, we look very closely at new buyer and repeat buyer and the rest of it is average spend per buyer.",

So typically, we see a 30%-31% GEP or non-Tanishq gold, and we see about 9-10% of Tanishq gold. This quarter, we have seen about 35% non-Tanishq gold contribution and very interestingly, close to 15% Tanishq exchange also.

In Quarter 1, it was 1% last year. We have been talking about our pricing competitiveness, actions taken by us, which have been playing out in the last year.

So can you just give more color to where this number will settle at and what has driven this increase particularly for first quarter this number looks quite high.\n\nAjoy Chawla: Yes. I'll take that question again, Ajoy here. So our inventory is pretty much as per plan and well -- and the stock turns are also good, actually, they're better.

Or any plans for that, raising equity?|\n|Ashok Sonthalia:|Ashok here, TEAL, as you would have observed from our commentary, we have a very, very strong order book.

And the second question is on the jewellery capital employed, at about net employed of INR 6,500 crores. So stable quarter-on-quarter, significantly higher than what it used to be in the past. So can you just give more color to where this number will settle at and what has driven this increase particularly for first quarter this number looks quite high.\n\nAjoy Chawla: Yes. I'll take that question again, Ajoy here. So our inventory is pretty much as per plan and well -- and the stock turns are also good, actually, they're better. The capital employed is higher because our GOL contribution has come down to a much lower figure, it's around 27% by quantity, I think, if I'm not mistaken. Typically, it should be in the 50% range.",

In the capital employed, we have seen against a INR 2,437 crores, our capital employed has gone up by almost INR 700 crores.

        "answer":"The fee income lines are expected to show improvement throughout the year, as mentioned by the Chairman of State Bank of India. He highlighted that the core income streams, including fee-based income, have been steady and have shown an improvement of almost 4% YoY. Additionally, he mentioned that the first quarter is unique in character due to various factors, such as the absence of carry forward recoveries from the previous quarter and one-offs in the last quarter of the financial year. These factors can impact the comparison of performance on a YoY basis in the first quarter.",

So, they have not availed and that is one of the reasons. But, we are very very mindful in terms of the quality of risk. If at all I may say so, we go for cherry picking in our international book, which is not like our domestic book. And, there we operate absolutely like a corporate bank. And, asset and liability both are priced... they are linked to the variable rates. So, we have already seen the kind of movement in the FED rate, etc. So, SOFR and SONIA all are getting influenced by that, and that is one of the reasons why we see the kind of NIMs which we are seeing.

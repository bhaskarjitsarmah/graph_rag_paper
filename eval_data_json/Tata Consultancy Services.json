Please go ahead.\n\nSudheer Guntupalli: Hi Krithi. Congrats and all the best once again on your new innings. Just a couple of questions. Last time when we announced our results, the banking crisis in America and Europe was just cooking. Now, is this issue still being referenced to by clients as a concern or is this subject largely behind, based on your client conversations?\n\nTotal Contract Value\n\nPage 13 of 25\n---\n# Tata Consultancy Services Earnings Conference Call\n\nJuly 12, 2023, 19:00 hrs IST (09:30 hrs US ET)\n\nK Krithivasan: We don't hear about this topic much. I would say that it is largely behind us. In fact, the large banks who are our primary customers are net beneficiaries. We don't hear this as a concern anymore, Sudheer.",
            "K Krithivasan: No. We are not being conservative or optimistic here. We are telling what we are seeing in the market. As we explained earlier also in the call itself, while the demand is still good, we are winning new deals, but clients are reviewing the projects underway, and wherever the ROI is not very strong, the next phase of the project is getting paused. So, that's the reason we find the revenues dropping.. Otherwise, we don't see a problem in the long-term. We don't see any issue with the demand or investment on technology.\n\nSudheer Guntupalli: Thank you, sir. That's it from my side. All the best.\n\nModerator: Thank you. We have our next question from the line of Apurva Prasad from HDFC Securities. Please go ahead.\n\nApurva Prasad: Thanks for taking my question.

A couple of questions from my side. Krithi, first on the nature of pauses which you guys have started seeing. What are you hearing from your clients in terms of what are the signs they are looking for which can make them change their view on these pauses or kind of pushouts? Is this something which people will still have patience for some time before they start pulling back their tech spending or do you think the uncertainty being where it is, if things don't worsen materially, the demand can come back on a shorter notice?\n\nK Krithivasan: So, Mukul, as you also mentioned, it is a near-term uncertainty which is causing the clients to re-look at the programs and pause them wherever they think the\n\nPage 15 of 25\n---\n# Tata Consultancy Services Earnings Conference Call\n\nJuly 12, 2023, 19:00 hrs IST (09:30 hrs US ET)"

Is this due to this whole change in model to Agile versus Waterfall? Is that causing people to be able to take this pause versus earlier you would really have for any deliverable, there would be months probably still to go. So you couldn't really halt everything mid-flight and now it makes it a lot easier to put these pauses?",

I realize that, gross margins have continued to take a hit, probably due to wage hikes this time. But if you look at the full year in FY\u201824, I know you expect margins to be clawed back. But do you think there is any chance that margins on a full year basis might actually not expand in FY\u201824 or might even decline despite the supply easing up?|\n|---|---|\n|Samir Seksaria:|Ankur, all our efforts collectively will be towards improving margins.

Two consecutive quarters of strong deal booking despite the weak market, not even including the BSNL deal, and this quarter execution also, largely played out in line with your expectations, and we are seeing market situation improved a bit, especially regarding this one panic factor, and you're saying pipeline is strong. How do we reconcile it with your tone in general on the demand situation? Is there a bit of conservatism you're baking in your tone to provide a buffer for any unexpected shock, especially since you have just taken charge?"

        "answer":"The spend in the manufacturing segment is being sustained by factors such as the low base effect, delayed increase in demand and growth compared to other industries, and the gradual easing of supply chain challenges. Additionally, the continued high demand from automakers is a significant driver for the stability in the manufacturing segment.",

And are we not facing the kind of delays that we are facing in, let's say, BFSI or other verticals, in the manufacturing segment? And do you think that manufacturing might continue to remain stable in the coming quarters as well?\n\nAnd a similar kind of opinion about retail. So in retail, we had seen a lot of weakness in the past couple of quarters. And again, not just for us, for the entire industry. Are there any signs of that segment bottoming out? If not today, maybe in a couple of quarters' time? Just a little bit color on these two verticals?",
            "K Krithivasan: I would say manufacturing is doing well because of the low base and the delayed pickup in demand and growth compared to other industries. And as the supply chain situation also eases slowly, customers are able to see the growth. Today you see the demand is still high for many of the automakers. I think that's probably driving it. And again, I won't be able to say how long this will last because it will eventually be a function of the overall economy.\n\nOn Retail, our view is, or what we see, the essential retail is doing well. But if it is luxury or fashion or other specialty retail, we find that there is a softness in demand in such sub-segments of the industry. So that's a broad color that we can provide you on these two verticals.",

Is it only the auto part of the manufacturing segment appearing stable at this point of time and looking to continue to spend?

I think, excepting one, quite a few of the sub-verticals are doing well.

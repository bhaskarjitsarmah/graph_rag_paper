So if you look at the retail market share, retail market share 36.6% for the quarter so there is no loss as far as the retail market share is concerned. In fact on a sequential basis, the retail market share up by 300 basis point so that is one number that we need to look at, the second is more fundamental is that when we are putting this launches, remember these launches doing well, is what we say is an indication that is coming from how well customers have received.

We also are taking EV as our starting point in lot of global markets as well. So we will see a lot of focus on whether it is through our GTM, whether it is through our product or whether it is through our digitally enabled services, we want to get to the leadership position very, very fast. I think your second question was around PLI incentive. So we are also working very heavily on making sure that we cater to all the criteria for the PLI and we will sort of announce when we are closer to those qualifications, but it is an important aspect for us and we are doing all which is required to make sure that we are ready to qualify for those requirements.",
            "Arvind Sharma: Sure. Thank you so much. Just one more question on the EV part. You have already reached the target level in terms of ICE margins. I think you again talked about it, but what has been a learning from Ather? At what level do you see that VIDA, where the pricing or the cost part is, where do you think it starts becoming at least EV neutral. Not talking about the units per se but there may be this year or next year because either the ICE margins are very strong, so when can we see that the impact of VIDA is not that high 70, 80 bps, what is the timeline that one could see?",
            "Swadesh Srivastava: Yes, hi Jinesh I will take this up. So yes, as you heard we had announced that starting with the three cities from last year, we will be going to 100 cities this year. We are already at 36 cities and we will, well before the end of the calendar year, we will be reaching 100 cities and you all aware that we are coming out with 3 formats - we started with experience centres, now we are doing VIDA pods which are shop-in-shop and you will also see some of our dealers putting EV, specific dealerships over the course of this year. So we are really building that platform very strongly. We are also expanding our charging infrastructure, to have convenience to the customer and not have the range anxiety. I also want to share that we have also partnered with Ather, where we have made the investment and we have also partnered with them for a common connector and you will see interoperable charging network coming out very soon so that our customers will have much expanded charging network available."

Please go ahead.\n\nChirag Shah: Thanks for the opportunity sir. Sir a broader question on the demand side. If we look at over last 12 months or so, without going into a longer history because we know BS and emission norm transition etc. so even over last 12 months, while the industry is hopeful of demand recovery, somehow it is becoming elusive and getting postponed by quarter or two and which is a general industry comment rather than company specific comment. So what are the parameters that you are tracking closely internally to gain the confidence that from now on or second or third quarter, we should be back? Festive season, generally a seasonal every year it comes right, so that momentum will be sequential but I am now looking on a Y-o-Y basis.",

In the monthly release, you had talked about that there are some crop damages and that is something which is impacting the demand whereas you have also talked about with the earnings release that you expecting demand to recover and specially in the second-half you are expecting better demand. So what would translate from the near term weakness which we are seeing right now, to a better demand in the second half?",

I am just trying to understand what are we doing here despite all the launches, if we are continuing to see market share slip, what explains that because in the core segment we have not lost market share as you alluded to. Just help us understand this gap between we are seeing at your end and we are seeing on the retail database."

Please go ahead.\n\nNischint Chawathe: You reported a fairly impressive 17% growth in unit linked policies. So, I was wondering what is driving this? Is it just that because equity markets are doing well? Is it just that the offtake is strong or is there a conscious push from your side for ULIP?\n\nManagement: No, I don't think we have ever pushed or stopped pushing for ULIP. It is a function of the overall market, the way people are perceiving like you would see in the last couple of years, a lot of non-par guaranteed got sold. So, it was purely a function of the experience of the last three years where you\n\nPage 14 of 25\n---\n# SBI Life Insurance Company\n\nJuly 25, 2023\n\nwere uncertain about your income and all and the first thing that you wanted to protect was future income.",
            "We keep explaining to our customers that the longer you stay with us, the more money you can make. And also, you stay protected with insurance. So, that is the most important thing. While you are building up your corpus, you are covered with insurance, which no other investment will give. So, this is something which actually works for us, and we will continue with that.\n\nNischint Chawathe: You're looking at share of non-par to kind of increase from 23% to like 25% by the end of the year. I mean if you're looking at the direction of the market, I think in all possibilities, non-par will remain here or go down given the way interest rates are headed. And probably ULIP will kind of continue to do well. So, in that sense, is it kind of fair to say that maybe the business mix of last year may not really be what this year would look like?",
            "Page 11 of 25\n---\n# SBI Life Insurance Company\n\nJuly 25, 2023\n\nthat when you have very good growth in all the products, then it is quite possible that in percentage terms, there may be slightly lower growth seen here in protection because everything is growing, so everything grows at 20% or something. So protection, even if it grows slightly less in terms of actual numbers, appears to have de-grown in percentage terms. So that is the only thing that I would say. I don't think there is any particular thing to be read into the protection growth numbers.\n\nRishi Jhunjhunwala: Understood. And just secondly, on the margin trajectory for fiscal '24. So just wanting to understand, is there any particular kind of mix that you are thinking would play out through the course of the year, given the kind of changes that have happened on taxation on EOM and everything, which could potentially change the mix of the margins, especially on the product side?",
            "So the huge pent-up demand that we had and the agents and our distributors had already gauged due to which we had launched that product. That got taken up in the first quarter, and that is why you are seeing a de-growth in this quarter with respect to the non-par product.\n\nBut going forward, we are looking at a very steady growth in our non-par portfolio. And there is no conscious effort to reduce or change the mix. You will probably recollect that every quarter, I keep saying that we keep the customer at the center, and it is not a joke. We do keep the customer at the center. We offer products which are suitable. This quarter, we have seen a good traction for ULIP product returning. ULIP has always been a good product for us. ULIP has returned. One reason could be the market's excellent performance and our own funds excellent performance over the last five years. And this is something which people are looking at."

So, while we did really well in FY '22 when most of the other peers were struggling to grow protection, over the past four to five quarters, if you really look at it, the growth hasn't been that robust given the kind of under penetration we see in retail protection.

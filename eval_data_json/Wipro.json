Please go ahead.\n\n# Sudheer Guntupalli:\n\nYes, thanks for the opportunity. Thierry, just a bit on the macro, unlike during some of the previous downturns, this time around, many of the macro variables are continuing to be surprisingly resilient, both in U.S. and in Europe, except for a brief period of panic around the regional banking crisis.\n---\nwipro.com\n\nSo based on your client conversations, what is pe key concern or key variable pat you are gapering? Could it be pe end of pe rate hike cycle or what else could drive a return of pe spends? And if you were to second guess, how quick pat could be?",
            "Thierry Delaporte: Yes, Sudheer, I really like the question you just asked. I think it's a real one. And so let me try to respond to that. Interactions with clients have more or less, I would say, a similar pattern, which is that on one end, there is no one question the fact that technology is critical to the success of the evolution of the company, whatever the industry is, by the way.\n\nSecond, I think it's the recognition of the fact that over the last years, there has been massive investment made in technology. Now, and so there's certainly the fact that, macroeconomy continues to shed a little bit of, mixed messages to, those industries and to the leaders across those industries.",
            "And so at the end of the day, I've always been very confident on the fact that technology was, on top of each of these leaders' agenda and that, they have a lot of transformation programs in mind to drive and at the same time they are a little influenced. You know, I think it's even more than influenced. They are very aware of the fact that this climate of uncertainty is weighing on some potential decisions for company to continue the same volume of investment.\n\nSo they have made some choices and I think there's a certain level of cautiousness driven by the fact that the macro environment is still a little uncertain. So that's what I'm hearing. And that's probably, what we're observing is actually a reflection of that, Sudheer. I think that when we look at the type of deals we are winning, we are winning more deals than ever before. And that is being consistent for the last three or four quarters.",

And so that's what we are seeing.\n\nSecond question is about the perspective? What about the second half of the year? Again, really reflecting on my discussion with clients. There could be a point in time where they feel, okay, we have this budget that we haven't spent yet. The year has unfolded being possibly better than feared, so it's time for us to resume the investments or the spend."

            "# Jatin Dalal:\n\nYes, hi, Girish. I hope you are well. No, the answer right now is yes, in the sense that there is nothing unusual that we see on large deals that we don't normally notice. Obviously, if there is a USD200 million or USD300 million deal, you would benchmark it with the best standards on productivity, best standards on pricing, but that is not out of ordinary behavior of dropping prices or giving deferrals in billing, etcetera. Those behavior, we have not yet observed that would worry us.\n\n# Girish Pai:\n\nOkay, lastly on generative AI, there's been mixed commentary around the evolutionary impact of this on at least certain service lines. What's your take on this and how early or late will this happen, if at all it happens?\n\n# Jatin Dalal:\n\nYes, so Girish, your specific question is does generative AI already, is it already reflecting in reduction in revenue and potential headcount for the GBLs for our service lines?\n\n# Girish Pai:"

I'm not sure I can answer. It's too early to tell, right? You cannot make a trend based on 20 days or 30 days. So I don't think, I'm in a position or Jatin or anybody here is to tell you that, based on the last 30 days, we can see a trend. I think it's, this is the reality with the context of uncertainty. It is precisely, it's a little bit erratic. And so, some industries certainly are more pushers than others. Banking, financial services, technology, you see that. technology has reduced.",
            "Jatin Dalal: So, Nitin, first, what I want to share is in quarter one, despite a significant volatility in revenue, we have done well to stay flat on operating margins. And that was because of a variety of operational levers that we were able to manage very well, including improvement in utilization, which would have been, as you can imagine, quite difficult in such a revenue scenario.\n\nAs we enter quarter two, we definitely want to hold on to this trajectory and we will continue to leverage the efforts that we have taken in quarter one to continue with the same consistency in quarter two. As Saurabh mentioned in the press release, as we have spoken about it earlier today. We did our last salary increase in September of last year and we plan to do that for this year sometime in quarter three. So at least, for quarter two that's not something that, we are penciling in, at this point in time.",

Good evening and thanks for taking my question. I wanted to understand the assumptions that have gone into our guidance for the next quarter. Last quarter, if I remember right, we mentioned that, some of the clients had already intimated us about certain ramp downs and the impact was to be felt in one quarter. So our sense is that, that probably is in the base quarter now. So what is driving another, sort of at least at the lower end, another sequential decline for the next quarter? Have we seen more such intimations coming our way and project ramp downs continuing?"

It would be helpful if you could tell us how those graphs are looking like today. Or if you could disclose even future and net appreciation. And just as empirical evidence, how many customers would you have ended up projecting this quarter, both existing and new, simply because of this overleverage issue? Yes.\n\nRajeev Jain: In general, if I would take a funnel view, those customers to whom I gave B2B don't default it all. Of that, I land up offering a personal loan only to 60%. Eventually, I land up giving to 40%. That's the funnel view, all the way from B2B to conversion to a B2C. All pristine, right? Did not default, went through the filtration for B2B."

What is the secret pill behind very low senior management attrition? Till date we have only seen Ashish Sapra going out and Devang Mody going out and again coming back.

First quarter annualized attrition is at 13.8%. Last year same time, it was 14.5%.\n\nWe took a decision last year actually. The year before if you look at it, it was 28%. We took a decision that we need far greater stability across all levels of management, and that's why a set of management decisions were taken and they yielded a 19% annualized attrition last year.

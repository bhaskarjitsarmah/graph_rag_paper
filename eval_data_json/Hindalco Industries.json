Any update on that, given that we have about $200 million to $300 million of cost inflation, will it be offset by that or it will be fresh out flow?\n\nSteve Fisher: Sure. Not a large update. We have filed our requests under 48C. We will not have clarity as to any allocations towards either the Bay Minette project or Guthrie recycling project until probably the end of this fiscal year, that is March of 2024.

But what I can tell you is that net-net, we do not expect any margin dilution because with all the settling down of overall inflation, we will still be able to preserve our margin. So, all that I want to say is that we don't foresee any margin dilution even though there may be some price adjustment as we get into the next round of negotiations, given inflation is settling down. I hope that's a helpful answer.",
            "Gaurav Singhal: And then the second question more on the Novelis side. So, for the Bay Minette facility, where I understand, we have contracts with our customers. So, are these like take or pay contracts because let us say if macro weakens and for whatever reason the situation is very bad, how firm are these contracts? Like does the customer like have to pay. Is it like a take or pay or is there a risk that may not get the price that we contracted at?\n\nSteve Fisher: So, as we said on our call last week, we are fully committed with some contracts and it's very late stages of other contracts for two-thirds of the Bay Minette facility that will be for beverage packaging. We are also in line with our contracts on the auto sheet side. As relates to the contracts, these are multiyear contracts with like our current contracts and with take or pay arrangements.",

Please go ahead.\n\nGaurav Singhal: So, one is you mentioned that aluminum, you expect LME to be roughly around let's say $2100 to $2300 whereabouts which is only slightly lower than I think, where this average this quarter. So, for the India upstream business, should we expect like $650 a ton to be like a normalized EBITDA level for this kind of LME price? And also, once our mines come online, how much can the cost reduction benefit on a dollar per ton basis to be in the upstream?\n\nSatish Pai: So, I think that your first, I would say is roughly in the right ballpark. If it is in that range, the number that you had is more or less, right. I think how much you can get once the mine will come, it's better if we wait till the mines get commissioned and then we'll give you a more accurate number because the cost can come down by another 5% or 8% more with our own mines."

Slowdown is concentrated in advanced economies, where growth is expected to decline from 2.7% in 2022 to 1.5% in 2023. While emerging market economies are expected to grow at a steady pace of 4% in 2023. Restrictive monetary policy, slow recovery in China and sluggishness in manufacturing and trade activity are weighing on growth. On the upside, services sector expansion continues to drive growth.

And in terms of from the perspective of the thermal coal has been sort of weakening in the international market, at this point of time are the sort of the global thermal coal still in the positive area or are there any sort of, I just want to understand how much the cost support we have at the current price level?

Please go ahead, sir.\n\nSumangal Nevatia: Sir, my first question is with respect to our coal mix, if you could share what was it in 1Q and how do we see it changing in the coming quarters? And also on the cost front, if you see international thermal coal prices back to almost two-year low versus what we are kind of guiding for next quarter when maybe on a normalized basis is still much higher versus what we were say two years ago or three years ago before the Covid era? So, what is the change over the last year? Is there a significant mix change in coal and change in the cost of linkage coal as well?"

But now, let me conclude today\u2019s presentation by some key takeaways. We as a Company are working proactively to mitigate the current macroeconomic headwinds and cost pressures. Our resilient India business is providing solid financial prudence with its strong balance sheet for our organic growth strategies. We also continue to focus on resource security in terms of coal and bauxite, thereby reducing our dependency on external sources while expanding our value streams in terms of downstream products."

But what I can tell you is that net-net, we do not expect any margin dilution because with all the settling down of overall inflation, we will still be able to preserve our margin.

So, to allocate a mine to a private industry besides the subsurface rights, you will have to allocate the land as well to a private Company and the law did not really allow the CBA land to be transferred from a public sector unit to a private. So, the government has had to deal with that regulatory aspect. That's why many mines are stuck on this. But I think it's getting resolved now.\n",

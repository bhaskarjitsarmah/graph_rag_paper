And in spite of taking in the wage hikes and all those things, the exit could be still 17% to 18% as we have told earlier. As far as the specifics, I think you articulated very nicely in terms of the 3 trends that we are seeing. One is the delays in onboarding. The second is even after the delays in terms of ramp-ups, the revenue profile will be also different for some of these deals and then the freeze that we had in some of the BFS accounts. So given all these scenarios, I think we have to again watch this space. But if the delays continue for too long, which we don't know, it's not something that we have a good visibility into it, but if the delays continue for too long, then obviously, we have to look at how these delays impact Q2.

So one is you mentioned that sometimes, there are delays in the start. In addition, the deals that you have won, you also have a transition period and revenues will probably accrue post that. And the third was that I think the freeze on spending by some of your banking clients still continue. In that context, does it feel like Q2 would be softer than normal and one should actually anticipate a pickup in the second half and Q2 can actually be softer than what we originally thought, that was the first one. The second was on the margins, considering that we have wage increases, and we'll also have transition costs. Would it mean that we will see a dip in margin? And then the makeup in the second half, you also have higher pass-through revenue. So does that make it difficult to achieve the 17%, 18% exit, does that become difficult? So those are the 2 questions."

So people are looking to do programs, where the ROI , where there is clear benefit that the business is getting or where there is a need from a risk and compliance perspective, those are the programs that are getting funded. But what we are seeing is that what DC talked about, the continuing hiring freezes still continue.

This change is a part of the harmonization process, is in line with the industry practice and was effective 1st April 2023. Our sharp focus on managing our costs helped us deliver a 30 basis point Q-o-Q increase in EBIT margins. The bridge is as follows: increase in gross margins by 170 basis points, of which 120 basis points is on account of reclassification, 70 basis points due to operational efficiencies led by increased utilization and offset by seasonal visa cost of 20 basis points. A corresponding increase of 120 basis points in SG&A costs due to the reclassification and 20 basis point impact on account of increased marketing spend.

Or are we seeing the airlines and hospitality part also pick up now, which, as you had mentioned, are still, not maybe back to the pre-covid levels a couple of quarters ago.\n\nDebashis Chatterjee: Well, I would say travel and hospitality is seeing good traction and the business travel is not back to the same levels, but otherwise, we can see very good traction in terms of travel as well as in the rest of the hospitality, the hotels, etc., hotels as well as the restaurant chains, etc, all these things are definitely showing good traction.\n\nNitin Mohta: The next question is from the line of Ravi Menon.",

At the same time, we continue to see delays in decision-making and hiring freezes. However, we remain confident about our value proposition, along with the prospects of cross-selling and upselling to our existing accounts, especially with dedicated efforts towards our Focus 100 initiative. We are already seeing multiple deal conversations and wins through these efforts. As an organization, we have strategically positioned ourselves to help our clients in their transformation as well as efficiency agendas. Our ability to play effectively in both these areas gives us the confidence to continue our profitable growth trajectory even in the current dynamic market situation.\n\nLet me now open the floor for questions.",

We are also pleased to see the industry shifting towards predictive analytics and composite platforms that integrate a variety of data sources and analytical tools. With our diversified offerings across ERP, data and cloud, we are well positioned to help businesses address their twin objectives of experience and transformation.\n\nThe Travel Transportation and Hospitality vertical is experiencing robust demand for leisure travel, although the demand for business travel is yet to catch up.\n\nOur Health, Life Sciences and Public Services business grew 4.7% Y-o-Y.

            "Got it, DC. Second question to Sudhir, an extension of what I think somebody asked earlier. The divergence between the strong order booking and weak revenue booking for almost 3 quarters now. Some part of it obviously can be explained by the change in deal mix, tenure, etc. Some part is being attributed to the delays in ramp-ups because of the macro overhang. If I look at the 2, 3 global banks, which reported results so far, suggest tech spends continue to be healthy in June despite the banking panic. The crux of the problem lies in ramp-ups, not keeping pace with the order booking and parallelly, there are no material budget cuts, is it fair to expect 1 or 2 lumpy quarters of ramp-ups going ahead, which may translate into sharp pent-up revenue growth, for LTIM and of course for the industry as well.\n\n# Sudhir Chaturvedi:"

This change is a part of the harmonization process, is in line with the industry practice and was effective 1st April 2023. Our sharp focus on managing our costs helped us deliver a 30 basis point Q-o-Q increase in EBIT margins. The bridge is as follows: increase in gross margins by 170 basis points, of which 120 basis points is on account of reclassification, 70 basis points due to operational efficiencies led by increased utilization and offset by seasonal visa cost of 20 basis points. A corresponding increase of 120 basis points in SG&A costs due to the reclassification and 20 basis point impact on account of increased marketing spend. I would like to reiterate that the impact of reclassification as mentioned above, is EBIT neutral.",

And in spite of taking in the wage hikes and all those things, the exit could be still 17% to 18% as we have told earlier.

The second is even after the delays in terms of ramp-ups, the revenue profile will be also different for some of these deals and then the freeze that we had in some of the BFS accounts.

In Europe, our customers are carefully assessing their business needs and making strategic decisions about projects, budgets and IT spend. However, there is still strong demand for application management and SAP rollout and support deals.\n\nFor the quarter, our LTM attrition was 17.8%, down from 20.2% recorded last quarter. In-quarter attrition was at a similar level to that in the last quarter. And hence, we believe our attrition will continue to show a downward trend on an LTM basis. We are pleased to report that our utilization rate has shown a noteworthy improvement, reaching 84.8%. This was a result of our ability to deploy resources better as systems consolidation post-merger help improve visibility of available talent.\n\nI will now turn over the call to Vinit for Q1 financial highlights."

The account that you\u2019re talking about is part of LTIMindtree and it's still a significant account. So that seasonality will always be there. But I can only say that initially, those deals, say 3 years back, used to be renewed every year, but there is a more TCV factor in those renewals as well. And as far as the order book is concerned, you are right. I think we have called it out earlier as well that the order book, the deal flow is more in terms of efficiency oriented. And in some of these deals, it's a combination of efficiency and transformation. And we had announced one deal last quarter, which is onsemi, where the clients are willing to sign up for efficiency. And at the same time, they're willing to use those dollars, which can be coming out of efficiency deals over a longer period and continue the in-flight transformation as well. So, we see a flavor of those kind of deals more and more. The",
            "these days are longer-term efficiency deals. And what happens in these efficiency deals, they are longer tenure, but they also have a transition involved. And only after the transition, you get into the revenue cycle. So, it is important to close those deals sooner so that you get the benefit of those revenues for the rest of the year. So, a long story short, I think Q1 played out the way we wanted from an overall revenue perspective, but Q1 did not play out the way we wanted in terms of the slowness in decision-making as well as the freezes, which tend to be continuing, which is where we feel that the growth targets that we have said earlier, that becomes challenging. But at the same time, we will always have it as an aspiration. So that's the first part of it. Sudhir, do you want to add anything?",

adanient,"second question there is a sharp improvement in Mumbai Airport EVA-to-EBITDA Q-o-Q,
so is this primarily due to non-aero or have you seen this spending per pax increasing very fast
in the quarter, Q-o-Q?","Largely, the EBITDA growth and EBITDA is driven by two aspects. One, the spending by the
passengers and non-passengers at the airport and secondly, the increase in the actual gross spend rate of each of the passenger, so these two aspects contributing for the growth in AEL."
adanient,"My third question is Carmichael, is it possible to share the revenues and EBITDA for the quarter
and the related question is that in the segmental which you have disclosed, commercial mining
is one line item, I believe this primarily corresponds to Carmichael? Is my understanding correct?","Yes, the understanding is correct."
adanient,Can you please specify which are the countries where we are exporting our modules right now?,"Primarily, US and Europe, overall."
adanient,"What are our CAPEX plans especially for green hydrogen, airports and data center
segments for the next 3 years?","Overall in the longer term, the CAPEX plans don’t alter for the asset like for green hydrogen
full 3-million-ton facility, approximately $50 billion as we have outlined in previous year, so
that plan continues forward as it is."
adanient,What is the guidance for commercial mining this year?,We are hopeful of starting the open cut in Dhirauli mine which is the commercial mine in this financial year.
adanient,What is the volume guidance for this year?,"For commercial mining, I don’t think will get any volume this year in India."
adanient,"what exactly must be the trend going forward and also our utilization levels, if I am not wrong, are
somewhere around 60%. So, can we see better utilization going ahead as well?","The utilization levels will rise because the technology change was taking place across the line to Topcon. That is why the lines were stabilizing, so the utilization rate will rise, margins will not rise, but are expected to stabilize or very slight decline."
adanient,"can you help give a breakup of the $3.7 billion CAPEX plan
for this year across the different segments? ","Approximately about $300 million for Green Hydrogen, $1.1 billion for airports, approximately
$1.7 billion for the road network, just under $100 million for water, just under $200 million for
the Data Center, and then small completion cost for the copper project just under $200 million."
adanient,"Historically you sometimes give figures for expected volumes in IRM and mining services for the full year, what would be the number for FY24
which you would expect?","As far as the mining services is concerned, we are targeting to do about 35 million tons in India."
adanient,"And the solar modules, this 614 MW, so we should expect like what would be the number for
solar module segment in terms of MW?","We expect the run rate to continue on broadly in these, from a quarter-to-quarter it is not expected to change, but you can expect the run rate at the same level."
adaniports,"My first question is in FY2022 end your warehousing capacity was 0.8 million square feet and so far till Q1 FY2024 you are at about 1.6 million square feet how
will the ramp up to 60 million square feet is phased out and what will be the associated capex?","So, we have roughly as of right now 5 million square feet under construction. We would be looking to add roughly 10 million square feet every year in order to reach that target."
adaniports,What will be the associated capex production?,"So, this year's capex guidance already takes into account the 5 million square feet and for the remaining we would look at roughly Rs.1800 to 2000 per square feet as a ballpark figure to compute the capex."
adaniports,"Could you help disaggregate the logistics rail volumes of 131,420 into exim and domestic and basically what has been the here on volume growth?","Roughly 90% of our volume is exim, 10% is domestic and we mainly run Mundra and Patli
and Kila Raipur as the circuits and we have a very balanced route right now"
adaniports,"Can you provide what the debt and cash numbers were at the
end of the quarter?","The total gross debt is 48,800 Crores and cash is 9,800 Crores so total net debt is around
39,000 Crores."
adaniports,Is there any one off in any of the other ports as well where the particular cargo or particular receipt is helping boosting the margins?,"No, there is no one off in any of the port items at any places."
adaniports,Could we just get an idea how the ramp up will go from 40% to 100% in the next 18 months. ,"We are currently in implementation of 250 megawatts of renewable energy, which we expect
to be commissioned by April 2024. The 250 megawatts we would be reaching roughly 90%
of the renewable share."
adaniports,"My question is a bit medium term as there has been any talks conducted with the Gujarat Maritime both on extending Mundra ports concession,
there are few news reports last year, but been no updates beyond that or is it too early to sort of think about that at the moment from the company’s perspective?","As we have been mentioning we are touch with Gujarat government to come out with a
policy, it is not just Mundra port but all the private parts which are operated in the state of
Gujarat. The government is formulating a policy. We are hopeful that we should be able to
hear something soon, but as of right now there is no new update to give on that."
adaniports,"Sir the realizations for Q1 are down on Y-o-Y and Q-o-Q basis is it purely because of the mix
and have we taken the price hikes for the year?","You are right, actually it is about couple of percentage reduction, but it is by and large because of the mix but the important number to note is actually the port EBITDA which actually is at 72% and also in absolute terms the EBITDA has grown as well so you are absolutely right, it is mix."
adaniports,Okay and Sir have we taken the price hikes for FY2024?,"Yes, we have taken."
adaniports,"Is there any capex guidance you can provide in this case for next three to four years at Dighi
port.","It will be hard to give you a port-by-port guidance. I think what we give as an overall guidance
that includes all of these things."
apollohosp,"So, I just want to understand what's our target for this INR 10,000 crore, don't we need additional stores, or we think we're going to have a much lower run rate this year?","We have factored about 500 to 600 stores to be added during the year. Q1, consciously we slowed down because in the Q4 last year, we added about 370, 380 stores. And in the last month of March, about 150 stores. So, we want to give that space to stabilize those stores. And Q1, we are back to our normal store openings, and we expect to be there between 500 stores and 600 stores for the year."
apollohosp,"So how should we look at ARPOB growth outlook for, say, next one year to two years?","In terms of how do we look at occupancy, I think that is the important question that we have headroom for growth and that in places like Chennai, we're already 41% of total market share. And we see, we are growing this. So, with this, I think it's going to be, as we go forward, this was asked earlier, it's going to be higher occupancy, resulting in higher EBITDA and also higher EBITDA margins coming from the cost, fixed cost being met. And therefore, we are quite confident that, that this is the way forward."
apollohosp,"And the transacting user number that you have given for this quarter and
comparable quarter, would you be able to share the number for quarter 4?","So, in the previous quarter, Q4 if you are referring to, it was about INR
9.9 lakhs."
apollohosp,"When I look at it from two years to three-year perspective, pre-COVID let's say, FY19 or FY20, how
would have our payer mix looked? ","I think pre-COVID self-pay was almost around 45%. Now if you look at self-pay as a percentage of revenue, it is 40%. Insurance is where we have had significant increase, where it was close to 25% to 28% pre-COVID, that has come to 44% of our revenues now. "
apollohosp,"What would be for the split for a previous quarter, like Q4?","Q4 for pharmacy was INR 375 crore and diagnostics was INR 42 crore. Diagnostics went up by about 16% to 18% for the quarter. And pharmacy, as I said, in the previous question that we took certain decisions to let go those volumes which are not profitable to the organization and that is the reason we see that gets settled in Q1."
apollohosp,"If I may ask last question, what is the tax rate?","The tax rate is 25% overall for the Company. And in the standalone, it is 25%. What happens in consol, you see it at a higher number."
apollohosp,"In the previous quarter, you issued both combined pharmacy EBITDA and someone previously asked that it was not quoted as well as we are expecting some ramp-up from the recently added stores. So if you could please tell the combined pharmacy EBITDA?","On the combined pharmacy EBITDA, as I explained to you that last year, we added about 1,000 stores, and it will take about 1 year, you know 12 to 15 months for the breakeven. So those higher number of stores contributing to the losses has impacted, and we will be back in the next 2,3 quarters."
apollohosp,"Firstly, on the occupancy side, the target which we have 70%, can we reach and sustain that 70% for the long period of time?","No that 70% will not require any capex, but this will take us a little time to get to 70%. We're already trending. Probably, we'll reach close to 70%."
apollohosp,"And lastly, in terms of the scalability of your healthcare business, if you hypothetically think of doubling your healthcare revenue from current base, what are the challenges comes to your mind?","I think when we are looking at doubling, yes, we are adding beds to ensure that we have beds to fill. But more importantly, again, it's the fact that we still have, by increasing 20% occupancy, we're actually taking up our revenue by another 40%. So clearly, there is headroom to grow, do have plans. And I think that there is strong traction in the Hospitals division. This quarter should be a very good quarter. And I think you could look at it next quarter."
apollohosp,And then how should we see the EBITDA percentage improving with relation to GMV over the next couple of years?,"I think today, if I look at the margin mix, my margin mix is also steadily going up. It used to be about 6% to 7%, 6.6% of the margin to the revenue in Q1 FY23. It went up to 7%, 9% and 9.7% over the previous quarters. This quarter, it is 10.89%. I think the next 2, 3 years, for sure it is going to be more than (inaudible) %."
asianpaint,"So, you think second half is going to be better as compared to the Q1 weakness?",We think the business would definitely improve because the weakness was coming also because of a little bit of a base which was very high. So definitely there will be an improvement.
asianpaint,"I was just trying to push the bubble by saying that given one does not have a material one time, what we saw almost about 23% margin, that logically one does not see any risk to that continuing and hence there could be possibly an upside risk to your guidance?","You are right as it depends also in terms of if we really look at some changes with respect to pricing in other areas, then possibly it would, come down and might not remain in this level. I mean if there is going forward in H2, we see a larger inflation kind of coming back. But I think we are in a good positive band in terms of what we are looking for the year."
asianpaint,"And in general, how long does it take for the dealer to generate the requisite ROI?","What we also feel is that today, it's a journey in terms of how the retailers start. They might do a certain amount of business in a year and they kind of keep on growing progressively over the next 3-5 years and therefore the drop out of a dealer, from the point of view of year one dealing with us to kind of going to year three, year four is not very high because we look at putting in a tinting mechanism."
asianpaint,"My first question is we have seen the Kitchen and Bath business kind of struggle to scale up immensely. If you could take us through the journey, what have been the challenges? ","When you look at the last three years of journey, first year in Kitchen and Bath, we grew almost about 35%. Second year again, we would have grown at about 30-35%. Last year we grew almost about 10-15%. So last year was a bit slow and this year in the first quarter, we are
seeing to some extent the business slowing down because of the large base."
asianpaint,"When we say NPD contribution, is 11% of sales, how do you define the NPD? Like, what period of launch were these products launched within?","So normally it takes us almost about 1-2 years to kind of launch the product and then sustain it. So, we normally define it as NPD over 3 years. So that's how a new product is defined."
asianpaint,"What do you think in our case, how the price cuts will be implemented and how would the channel react to those price cuts?","So as far as Asian Paints is concerned, I think we don't depend on channel inventories a lot because our channel inventories are to a minimum level because of the fact that we are able to service the retailer at least almost about two times in a day. And therefore, I think we don't really encourage too much loading the retailer in terms of inventories. However, in some months, if there are stocking months and if there is any price corrections, we are willing to give concession to the retailer in terms of a back linkage, which happens on certain stocks."
asianpaint,"But just wanted to understand, because you made some remark, that the premium luxury segment is not to the expectation in the middle and lower end is grown faster. Is this the industry trend
because the local competition has picked up very well","There is no middle and lower end premium and luxury. There are only three segments: economy segment, premium segment and luxury segment. What I said was that the economy and the premium segments are doing well, and the luxury is a little bit down. If you look at the market constraint, the economy segment is the biggest segment which is there, followed by premium and luxury. And therefore, you will have to perform in the economy segment if you are looking at overall volume and value growth in terms of turning the tables."
asianpaint,"The festive demand strength should reflect in the next quarter because the channel gets filled. So, the longer festive period benefit should flow through in the second quarter. Is that understanding correct?","What happens is that retail season is about at least about 45 days before the festival. So, if Diwali is in the first week of November or in the first ten days of November, normally what happens is that the period from 15 September to October end would be a strong retailing season. We feel that the larger impact would come into Q3, but impact should come into Q2 as well because there is a retailing period which gets impacted by the festive area. So, we would see that both quarters show an uptick with respect to the long festive season."
asianpaint,You are happy with 30% growth rate for this Kitchen and Bath business? ,"Happiness is a relative state of mind. I might be happy with tripling business also going forward, but you need to be practical in terms of the way you want to grow and not really strain the system."
asianpaint,"If you look at the Q1 margins, they were pretty strong vs. of a guided range of 18-20%. So, what do you think is the best utilization of margin from here? ","We take a considered view in terms of how the margins are emanating and whether they are stable from a point of view of overall business and environment. We would obviously be aggressive with respect to our ‘Above the line’ and ‘Below the line’ programs. In terms of what we do in marketing and our share of voice in the market, our media spends and our other marketing activities, including, various measures on really exciting the market through various schemes and discounting mechanisms."
axisbank,"Sir, you clarified on the integration expenses. And last time also you had called out a number for integration expenses. And if you add both, then the integration expenses work out to roughly Rs 350 crores to Rs 380 crores per quarter. Is that the run rate we continue to expect in the next few quarters?","Slide 13 of the investor presentation clearly calls out integration expenses for the quarter. It is Rs 385 crores. We have said that we expect to incur integration expenses over a period of 18 months aggregating to Rs 2,000 crores pre-tax, Rs 1,500 crores post-tax. That number stands. You may see some inter-quarter fluctuations, but we stand by the gross number of Rs 2,000 crores. And for the quarter, it is Rs 385 crores."
axisbank,Some banks still have excess liquidity. A lot of banks have not grown deposits this quarter but it intensifies from next quarter. So how do you view your deposit mobilization in the context of your margins from next quarter onwards?,"As far as the growth in deposits is concerned, it continues to be an effort across the banking sector, no doubt about it. But we continue to stay focused on what we have picked up as some of the elements of execution over the last few months, which is primarily focused on sweating the franchise and the distribution."
axisbank,"There's been a little -- the growth has been a little moderate there for a couple of quarters. And is there something in terms of demand that you're seeing, which is leading to this kind of moderation?","So last year, we had started on our improvement of NIM journey. And as part of that, we had taken some initiative to rationalize costs. And one is, now our NIMs are where we want them to be. So we will be growing our home loan book. We've already put in place initiatives to grow that book and that will be visible in Q2, Q3 onwards. Net of home loan, every other product is doing well. Home loan, we have a plan in place to grow the book."
axisbank,"We have seen a good improvement in Tier 1 this quarter despite the rise in RWA to total asset ratio. So what has really driven this, is this one-off or do you think that this is going to steadily improve over the coming quarters?","Our current CET1 stands at 14.38%, well above our philosophical rebase level, well above what we need to protect our domestic AAA rating, sufficient headroom for us to grow at 400 basis points to 600 basis points higher than industry credit that we've indicated we would like to grow at. Therefore, we do not have any plans currently to raise capital for the growth outlook that we have for FY24. "
axisbank,While you have a guidance around cost to asset but how are you looking at the branch expansion over FY '24 to FY '25?,"So on the branch expansion plan, as we have said earlier too, we continue to look at white spaces across the country, both in Bharat and the urban markets. Current financial year, we are looking at around 400 branches incrementally for the year. And we will keep ourselves open for any kind of opportunity which further comes up."
axisbank,"Firstly question was on the outflow rate for the LCR calculation, there was an improvement of 460 bps. And that improvement is being utilized in the lower surplus liquidity, so including the asset yield. So just wanted to understand, what is the longevity like how much more we can improve the deposit profile and use that to improve the overall margin profile? ","As we would see on slide 18 of our presentation, we've called out a June '23 outflow rate of 23.7%. If you look at broadly our peer bank set, we've reached the rates that they have historically operated in and continue to operate in. So the efficiency there would be at the margin because we've seen a significant improvement in the last 24 months. So that lever of NIM improvement is getting optimized and may have limited to no scope of improvement on a go-forward basis."
axisbank,"So recovery numbers, we can understand but the seasonality of this rural slippage number. So can we see this number in any other quarter, Q3 or Q4 or like it will happen just in Q1. So if you can help there?","Typically, rural NPAs is the May-November cycle. So you will see a quarter 1, quarter 3 impact of the rural cycle. The other products typically don't have the seasonality that comes through the rural loan portfolio"
axisbank,"So once the branch -- new branch is open, like how much time it usually takes to reach the desired metrics in terms of loans and deposits?","On an average, we are now looking at the branches becoming fully profitable in the ballpark of couple of years. Obviously, there will be outliers, some of them may come in faster. Some of them may go beyond. But on a broad basis, couple of years is where we look at the customer base kicking in and a granular kind of approach in terms of getting the profitability."
axisbank,"How do you see like passing on the rates to the customers in the retail segment, especially fixed rate book like in personal loans and other products?","Like I said earlier, we've seen an improvement on our yield on advances. We are also seeing improvement in yields on disbursements, which is why we've been able to offset the 31 basis points cost of deposits increase. So that's visible in the numbers that we are reporting. Having said that, the market is competitive. We operate in a competitive market space. And consequently, there will be pulls and pressure on pricing for the customer profile that we would like to have. So, I think it's a market dynamic. We are a large and active participant."
axisbank,"So I just wanted to understand if the P&L trends stay in the NII and fee line, are broadly similar on an accretion basis?","What we also set out in the pro forma disclosure was an ROE number, which was 19%-plus. We do believe that, that number is deliverable post full integration and therefore, the business should be ROE accretive for us. "
bajaj-auto,"And price hikes if you have taken any, after the first quarter?","I can't recall anything which is of a material impact at the moment. We may have done a correction in some states, slightly more to just correct price value equation, but nothing of significant note or material note. At least what I want you to register is given the commodity cost context at the moment, we're not seeing the pressing need for us to take pricing to cover commodity cost inflation, not at this point of time."
bajaj-auto,"And sir, export markets like you have said, you have made several interventions to sort of manage the demand. So, any price corrections did we do?","See, our approach is that we cannot deal with the macroeconomics of currency devaluation through change in FOB pricing. Because that just doesn't work out. So, if there have been any pricing changes, they've been more in response to a competitive situation or an opportunity to improve rather than to the macroeconomic condition. So, we will continue with that approach."
bajaj-auto,"So, you said that we plan to expand from 17 to maybe 50 locations in the next few months. Possible to highlight what percentage of the addressable market is this covering? ","By end of this year, we will be covering almost about 60% of the addressable market through at least one store in the location. "
bajaj-auto,How the ramp-up will happen after that?,"At this point of time, we are making the plans as we go along basis each quarter. So, we've got a line of sight for end of the year. In another 3 months, we'll have a rolling plan which sort of addresses the quarter 1 of next year. "
bajaj-auto,"What I was looking for was more colour on the customer profile, what you're attracting, just to ensure that it's not kind of cannibalizing your existing KTM portfolio or the Dominar portfolio, if you can share some colour on the kind of customers you're getting?","But basis the qualitative inputs which we have received through sample discussions is that this is an absolutely new set of customers. They are not really from the heartland of, let's say, the Pulsar communities, majority of them are coming from the heartland of the 250 to 500cc segment aspirants."
bajaj-auto,"And on the export side, can you just help us understand how big is the addressable market for a product like this? ","This is an absolutely new segment in most of these markets for Triumph and for Triumph dealers, internationally."
bajaj-auto,Will the pricing strategy be led by Bajaj or how does that work?,"On the pricing front, the pricing is led by Triumph in their markets. And of course, there is a consultation, but really the lead person is Triumph like for Indian market, the lead is with us, of course, in consultation by Triumph."
bajaj-auto,"And on pricing, Rakesh, how are they priced compared to the CNG and other alternative fuel vehicles?","It's about INR3 lakh and INR2 lakh kind of a thing. INR3 lakh for the electric passenger and INR2 lakh for the CNG vehicle. This is ESRP post-FAME, so INR3.06 lakh ESRP post-FAME, and RE passenger is INR2.33 lakh."
bajaj-auto,How should one look at profitability going forward for the company?,"But let me say price versus cost seems well balanced out at the moment. And then you got to look at the two other factors, which is essentially operating leverage. So as business builds back, as volumes grow and as revenues start to build back there is an element of operating leverage that will come in. But yes, there could be a potential drag on mix coming in from our stated ambition and aspiration to grow the EV Chetak. And as exports and Boxers start to come back. So, there could be mix headwinds that we will see as we look forward."
bajaj-auto,What is the expected percentage company is looking –for the end of the year?,"I think there's a significant reset that has happened on the FAME subsidy policy, effective 1st of June. We need to wait and see the new normal of this market and as it emerges. Had it not been for this, our internal aspiration would have been to try and get this to a milestone of about 10,000 units of Chetak per month. So anywhere between, let's say, 3% to 4% is what we would like to have seen it by the end of the year, doubling from the current 2%."
bajfinance,"Would we say that ROA that we touched, the highest in the history in this quarter? ","Yes, so one of the things, Bharat bhai, that we've done as part of the Q1, because you don't want to be conservative, we don't want to be ultra-aggressive. For many years, our guidance was a 19% to 21% ROE. When I look at '19, '20, we were delivering 23%, 24% ROE. When I look at '23, I look at 23.5% ROE. When I look at the Q1, the number is 24.5% ROE."
bajfinance,"So going forward, is it more like 30 basis points or thereabouts remaining for the next three quarters and we still stay at 10% plus kind of NIM for the year?","We expect about 10 basis point to 15 basis point compression for at least two quarters and then of course, depending on where the interest rates -- yes, two quarters each, which is Q2 and Q3, and depending on where the environment is for the next two quarter, we can provide further guidance on Q4."
bajfinance,"What exactly do you mean by social and rewards, which is there in the presentation? ","Rewards, principally, when we look at -- the only way you could become a customer and by rewards is to go to times reward. It is not a reward platform. We landed a building rewards for closed loop architecture as a company, as a result of our digital transformation. "
bajfinance,"So out there, let's say, I look at the 1Q FY '23 numbers, those customers who are part of the 60 million, but not part of the 35 million cross-sell franchise, can those customers be part of the 44 million cross- sell franchise today?","So this is -- the model is fixed, right. Customer can go in and come out, but it's very hard. Anybody who goes into 30 million plus, mind you, never it's only possible where a customer defaulted paid money in 15 days can be going in and out. Any customer whoever went into 30 million plus, can never move these -- the filter. I think just at a fundamental level, you should be clear."
bajfinance,Will the rewards of some subvention angle attached to it because there's a full traceability that you are stimulating the customer?,"Independent business units, insta EMI card runs as independent business units from B2B in a way. We originate customers, customers can convert, but will you see things come together in some form and -- in many forms and manner on the app from the consumer? The answer is yes. So it'll be propositions would differ and so on and so forth."
bajfinance,"One is, we have actually doubled or over more than doubled the gold loan branches quarter-on-quarter. Also, going by your Annual Report disclosures, the portfolio is 1.53% overall. So how do you perceive this business going forward?","We -- it's INR3,200 crores odd balance sheet at this point in time. Foresee ending balance sheet could be anywhere between INR5,000 crores to INR5,500 crores. We have doubled. We have doubled down on the business. We have cleared our head on it and it's doing quite well now. And if the first half goes well, we may further accelerate branch expansion. We now have 564 branches."
bajfinance,"Sir, second question is, are we okay disclosing captive versus non-captive portfolio on two-wheeler, three wheeler side or is it a little too early?",Very early.
bajfinance,"As per the Annual Report disclosure, the unsecured portfolio ECL coverage has gone to 75%. It used to be around 77% odd during COVID. Sir, could you provide some color around that?","I was just saying, the number has remained range bound only, right. It's 75%, 77%. So nothing has changed materially. The composition of balance sheet between of Stage 3 between, say, 3 months overdue to 4 months overdue to 5 months overdue require different levels of provisioning, it's because of that. Otherwise, nothing has changed."
bajfinance,"So, what would be the attrition rate at your sales staff, or at the junior management level at Bajaj Finance, and how has it been trending?","So, the approval rates would look closer to '19, '20. We had gone significantly, I think, till I would say October '22 because we are still suffering from pandemic experience since October '22, we started off slowly release. "
bajfinance,"And just quickly one last question from my side, the share of LRD and the DF portfolio is on the rise. Where do you think this stabilizes in the BHFL mix?","Now between LAP and LRD, where we want our portfolio to be in the range of around 22% to 25% roughly is the computed answer there. That is where you see the LAP growth being comparatively lower and the LRD growth comparatively higher because we prefer LRD overlap, but between mix of LRD and LAP, you will see 22% to 25% portfolio mix on a steady state basis."
bhartiartl,So Soumen the SG&A cost for the mobility business are you saying that it could have moderated in the current quarter despite the India SG&A cost rising sequentially is that what you are saying?,"Yes, it would have been almost at same levels sequentially."
bhartiartl,First question is on how do you see the impact of Jio Bharat phone on the feature phone market?,"I would say that it is early days, I think that even when it was launched last time we did see an impact, at that point in time the feature phone market was much larger than what it is today. "
bhartiartl,what do you see a reason to not go for a device like this?,"Because largely these devices are only used for calling and we do not need to get into this device segment that is already there in the form of a feature phone. If we did not have a 2G network then that user would be excluded then we would look at it, but we all have a 2G network, and we have feature phones in the open market, which even today are getting shipped."
bhartiartl,"If you can share your thoughts on 5G monetization, and if you can provide any data on how many users, what kind of usage, what proportion of volumes are on the 5G network now?",It is still early days because the overall installed base is still low it is 14%-15% it is not grown at the rate that we were expecting it to grow. Even today 5G shipments are only about 48% of the total shipments. So it is still moving slowly and it will take time for the full upgradation to happen.
bhartiartl,"Second question is on your rural expansion program, can you give us a progress and how has been the response as you roll out new sites there?","In the rural areas I think we are kind of 60% through our rollout now. This has gone very well actually, the revenue per site the action standards we have set for ourselves we have been able to marginally beat it and the cost per side also is lower than what we thought it would be again."
bhartiartl,"If I may ask on the postpaid, is it possible to split let us say not in this quarter only but last three quarters or four quarters what is the port-in contribution?","We do not provide that information I think so we do not look at it like that because sometimes whether it is supported or whether it is new customer or whether it is a new addition it really does not matter as long as it becomes the primary SIM where a lot of consumption is happening, and they are pleased with the experience."
bhartiartl,"Just continuing on that millimeter side, Reliance Jio has said that they are looking at 4G slicing as a tool which is allowed in the SA, and they want to deploy FWA and they want to accelerate their growth in the fixed broadband and considering that we are on a non-standalone, will that limit our capability to that per year?","No, firstly let me disabuse you of that notion. I think there are two parts to the question, one is FWA itself and the other is slicing. "
bhartiartl,I am keen to understand how you think about your ARPU trajectory going forward. Do you see it more like a steady compounding profile?,"Yes, I think it is a good question, a big increase in ARPU can only happen with a reset of the tariff table"
bhartiartl,"I was just curious on the ARPU. Just if you can give us a bit more color on the medium-term outlook for ARPU Rs 300 obviously is the longer-term plan now it is Rs 200 with all the levels that you have described with postpaid and what you have just said, how should we think of the next few quarters in terms of our ARPU. ","I am afraid, I would not be able to give you a number there, but I think that like I said suffice it to say that we would be disappointed
in ourselves, if we do not see some improvement in ARPU equating for days and all of that on an organic basis every few months.
So I just leave it at that."
bhartiartl,"First on the 5G side, one of your peer has said that they are through with the 65% of the rollout and it appears that in the first stage they will be doing 175000 towers. Where are we in comparison as far as the 5G rollout goes?","I do not have the precise numbers I think Soumen may have the number on the radar capacity upgrade, it is a very substantial increase that happens almost about 5x to 7x but I think Soumen will probably be able to give you a better answer on that."
bpcl,My question relates to BPCL refining margins for the Mumbai Refinery. Why the margins were so low versus Bina and Kochi?,"If you see our Mumbai Refinery configuration, their high sulfur percentage will be lower. They can process low sulfur grades will be on higher quantum and high sulfur grades will be at a lower quantum. Second, even if we see the combination of crude processing in Mumbai Refinery, the Russian crude composition will be lesser in Mumbai Refinery as compared to Kochi Refinery and Bina Refinery."
bpcl,"for the Mumbai Refinery, what would be the total share of the Russian crude sourcing which was done in this quarter?","One is, Mumbai refinery we cannot give exact number in terms of the Russian crude composition. In fact, Russian crude also we have two grades. One is low sulfur as well as high sulfur. But overall directionally compared to other refineries, the Mumbai Refinery cannot process Russian crude much beyond around 20%. Out of 20%, a good amount of crude has been processed in Mumbai Refinery. But compared to other refineries, the Mumbai Refinery can process very significantly lower quantum of Russian crude."
bpcl,"could you please reiterate what was the overall utilization for the petchem project in
this quarter? And how much was the GRM benefit if any?","in terms of PDPP performance, the particular units have been stabilized to a large extent. During the current quarter also, the units have been operated around 70% in physical parameters. And the GRM contribution this quarter, the petchem margins are not comparably high as compared to other previous periods. Roughly, the GRM contribution on account of PDPP will be around $0.4 to $0.5 per barrel this quarter."
bpcl,I wanted the refining inventory loss if you can give it now?,We don't publish the refinery inventory gain and loss.
bpcl,bhartiartl,"It is dual fuel only, but most of these configurations since we have a surplus naphtha available at some of the refineries, we want to take this naphtha to Bina Refinery so that we will get a more value addition. That is the objective. With this background, this project has been envisaged, by using more naphtha from our intermediaries."
bpcl,"Is it possible to give us information about what kind of plant shutdowns you have planned this
year?","I will share it with you. Currently, Bina Refinery is going to shut down for the month of July. Then, we will have some units of Kochi Refinery going for shutdown in the month of August
for 15 days. And then Mumbai Refinery, one of the CDU will go for shutdown at the fag end of September for a month."
bpcl,"It was on the CGD business in terms of the investments you are planning over the next 5 years. You said sixteen of these GAs are in commercial operations. What is the timeline to generate, say 10% to 15% ROCE on this investment? Is there any cash loss on this as of now?","As of now, we have already around 1,607 retail outlets where we have started selling CNG, where we are getting good margins. In terms of the return on investment, we have to wait for the completion of the total project. Then we will come to know what is the total CAPEX we have invested there and then we can work out. As of date, we are not foreseeing any cash losses for this business"
bpcl,"in terms of the Russian crudes usage, if the Russian crude prices cross USD 60 per barrel, would we be able to continue to make payment using the current mechanism or is there a risk that that could reduce the usage of Russian crude in our refineries?","Based on our experience, once the price is crossing beyond the threshold, we have faced a little bit payment issues earlier. Now we have to wait and see for the next cargoes when the payment dues are happening. At least for the time being, we are not foreseeing any problem because now more banks are ready for making the settlements. So, we have to wait and see. As of date, there are no payments which are pending for settlement. We have to wait and see. In case really if there is any purchase price beyond the price cap, see if there are any issues or not."
britannia,"So my first question is on the volume growth, which was flattish. So could you elaborate on what exactly you have done in terms of several pricing initiatives? ","So Abneesh, the fact is that we've not equated prices everywhere. We have taken a very cold call on what is necessary and what is not. Second is that the markets are a little sluggish compared to what we've seen in the past. What we've seen this quarter, and I'm not sure, I think I've heard the same commentary from other FMCG companies as well."
britannia,"So in terms of pricing, it's largely price cuts in select SKUs?","No. So it's basically grammage additions that we've done in certain cases. And in certain cases, we are looking at doing some article promotions and price cuts. So it's a mix of all these."
britannia,"So in dairy, you mentioned captive consumption of SMP, FCMs what does it translate in terms of, say, any savings in terms of cost? ","So what it does is it helps us fulfill our commitments to the farmers. We are collecting a lot of
milk from our farmers. We are processing that, and we are -- whatever is required from the
company's perspective, we are fulfilling that. At this point, there is no cost advantage of doing
that, but there is no cost disadvantage either."
britannia,"On Rusk, your commentary was that not very strong, reasonably strong in terms of growth. And you have been doing innovation very aggressively over the past many quarters. So what is the issue here?","So it's a mix of both. One is the market growth has been a little tepid. And second is that regional competitors, again, similarly to what I told you about biscuits, the same phenomena is happening here as well."
britannia,"First, would it be fair to say that 1Q reflects the entire impact of the rising price-based competition?","Well, I would not say that it's not flattish. If you look at our trajectory for many years, except
for -- so if you look at it, if you look at '21, '22, we were at an average of about 14%, right, on
operating profits. In Q1, we are at 15.6%. So what you are really looking at in the coin periods
of high numbers. So whether it's 2021, and obviously, last year, we were taking price increases
to make sure that we met our targets as far as inflation was concerned. So if you were to look at
-- if you were to draw a line progression line, I think we are moving in the right direction, and I
think that will continue."
britannia,"You had said that we should expect about 2% growth is what you have built-in or you would expect for the next year or this year. Does that need to be revisited, given the recent price cuts that have been done, or it's broadly in line with what you're kind of assuming?","Yes. No. So that 2% will probably not happen this year. It seems that it will be a flattish year
from a price standpoint. Yes. So it's not going to be a 2% increase. And the reason for that is the
commodity prices. And with that, I think we should be in a good place to make sure that we are
able to grow."
britannia,"So how do we explain that without too much pricing, the margins have still come off, and the volumes are also weak?","So in this quarter, we've taken price reversals of about 1.8%. There were fiscal benefits, which
were one-time PLI accrual, which was taken in Q4 last year, which was 2.4%. So price reversals
of 1.8%, fiscal benefits are because they were taken in Q4 and not in Q1. So that's 2.4%. There's
an employee cost increase, which is flattish. And there is a decrease in other expenses, which is
led by advertising spend, which is about 1.2%. So versus Q4, we are negative by 3.3%. So that
is the number that you're looking for, I believe."
britannia,"So how do we look at margins for the rest of the year? Should we believe that unless the commodity prices change versus the current levels, the margins that you have currently sort of done are a good representative of what should continue in the future? Or do you think that it could drop further because you might take further price cuts?","No. So the way to think about it, the way I think about it is that the priority for us, we are reasonably profitable. I think we are -- our margins are very robust and healthy. The trick is growing our top line and making sure that we get the volumes and the shares which are required,
and with that will come the margins."
britannia,"For the full year, what is the expectation for incentive?","So we are in the process of -- yes. Because some of these in PL, for instance, it is an incremental sale that comes out of all the factories in TM. So it's not a straightforward computation. So it will take us some time before we can quantify and see what are the products which are happening in this factory and 4 other factories, which are also there in the state, etcetera. So we'll make an assessment, probably H1, and we should be able to make an assessment."
britannia,"So you mentioned you probably need to take some more price corrections. And our understanding is there is a bit of a sequential up move we are seeing in edible oil, sugar, and possibly even in wheat flour. So in this environment, do you not feel that there could be more pressure in margins in the near term? ","No. So see, edible oil, there is no uptick. Edible oils actually are at the lowest ever in the last 3,
4 years. Sugar, yes, there has been a little bit of inflation, but I think the government is very clear
that they want to control this. So I don't think there's going to be much inflation as far as sugar
is concerned. Flour is the one which we really have to watch because the production hasn't been
as good this year. And while the inflation currently is low single digits, but we've got to watch
that. But at this point in time, it seems we are covered for the next 3 or 4 months."
cipla,"Umang, is on the future pipeline in the US. So you mentioned about 4, 5 peptide launches. Leuprolide seems to be having low market share. So how should we think about the potential of this peptides? And also particularly on Abraxane, is the bottleneck just around the site? Or are there any queries on the file that we need to address there?","Saion, on Abraxane, we have received notification that the only thing pending on the file is the site. And on your other question and I'm sorry, that was on Leuprolide, you will begin to see share gains because for that, we were waiting for certain price approvals in the market and certain codes being assigned, which is now done. Their codes have been assigned. So hopefully, you will see increase in market share there."
cipla,"Umang, this quarter-on-quarter improvement in the US, what do you ascribe this to? Is there a big Revlimid contribution? And in the next few quarters, how we should think about it?","I don't think the Revlimid contribution quarter-on-quarter is significant, Saion. The base business has also grown very impressively between quarter 4 and quarter 1. And of course, between quarter 1 of last year and quarter 1 of this year, we have seen our base business also grow tremendously. So quarter-on-quarter there is not a material difference in Revlimid between quarter 4 and quarter 1."
cipla,"Umang, is on the future pipeline in the US. So you mentioned about 4, 5 peptide launches. Leuprolide seems to be having low market share. So how should we think about the potential of this peptides? And also particularly on Abraxane, is the bottleneck just around the site?

Their codes have been assigned. So hopefully, you will see increase in market share there."
cipla,what would be the guided capex for FY '24 for Cipla?,"Yes. So we said about 5% of the revenue, 4% to 5%, somewhere in the range of INR1,000 to INR1,500 per annum is what you could take as the capex, which can be in the area of sustainability, modernization, as well as in some cases capacity enhancements."
cipla,"what part of this capex would be attributable to solely maintenance, wherein that would not lead to any kind of capacity expansion? Just pure maintenance capex?","Without giving a split, it's a combination of both the capacity enhancements in API formulation as well as the -- there's maintenance capex. They can be small, when you're de-risking some of these assets of the US portfolio, there can be small capex on account of that as well."
cipla,I was also looking to understand this maintenance capex. So would this be in nature of what kind of equipment’s are we looking at? What is the addition that would be made to our business as a whole?,"Its sustainability related, environment related and the maintenance. Sometimes in some of the plants, we have to take shutdowns to make sure that the equipment’s are properly functioning to improve efficiencies, s etc."
cipla,Compared to previous quarter guidance of 22% and now we are talking for 23%. So broadly what has changed that gives the confidence of 23% EBITDA margin?,"Sure. No. So I think it's our target that we've taken. We've had a good quarter, this quarter 1. So it gives us some confidence that, we can take up that target of delivering 23% for the year. And you have to bear in mind that, seasonality of each quarter as well. So that also plays a role. So we've had a good quarter. But overall, we target to 23%."
cipla,"While the classification is awaited, but has there been any feedback from US FDA apart from classification to understand particularly -- ultimately to the Generic Advair approval and launch?","We have heard that Generic Advair is now on the pending facility. And therefore, the fact that it is not yet cleared right now means the facility is still under evaluation. Having said that, the whole Advair transfer to another facility is underway. The facility is getting ready for this in the US and very soon the transfer activities will start."
cipla,"So the USD222 million revenue run rate, do you think it can sustain going forward in the coming quarters?","Our base level will be somewhere in the range of USD210 million to USD215 million, which is -- the quarter -- what I meant by USD210 million to USD215 million was what we will be reporting broadly, going forward quarter-by-quarter. But if you were asking whether our base business -- our base business would be slightly short of that."
cipla,"Umang, coming back to Advair. So should we assume -- like you mentioned 12-month for -- transfer rate -- transfer to the additional site and then, there is a timeline associated with amendment, etcetera. So broadly, should we assume this opportunity is now beyond FY '25?","No, not beyond FY '25. Beyond this year if Indore is not cleared, yes, but not beyond FY '25."
divislab,what is the scope of passing this further to our customers and hence what would be the sustainable gross margin as far as generic API business is concerned?,"In the generic portfolio, based on the competition, if the general prices of raw materials have come down, probably the demand from the generic industry may be there asking us to bring down the prices, but where we are in generic industry lump products where with long term arrangements, usually we don't have that. So we will be able to retain the extra margin whereas in custom synthesis, we can retain the margin when the raw materials goes down or raw materials go up to a certain percentage beyond which we will discuss."
divislab,"Just on the split of generic and custom that was shared, so when I just add the generic piece and the nutraceuticals together and look at growth on Y-o-Y basis, it seems to be still subdued, like low single digit, like flattish kind of a Y-o-Y trend, even if I look at it compared to the quarter before also, it seems to have declined. So, just want to understand and also reflect upon our guidance for fiscal 24 when we exclude Molnupiravir we are looking at double digit growth, so if you can help us understand that, sir?","I wouldn't say there is a decline in the quantity of generic API, yes, I agree with you the growth of the matured generics is in the single digit, yes, but when you say that in a compound of 5000 tons even a single digit can be substantial, let’s say 5% growth. We are talking about 250 ton growth year-on-year, then there will be always new entrants to take some of the capacity or some of the products from the market, but we are in the advanced markets where it is highly regulated. So there, after the COVID which is over towards the end of the last year, now everything is getting stabilized to see first anti-infective, then antibiotics ant-infectives, then life-saving medicines, lifestyle medicines. We are more into the lifestyle medicines in the generic market. So, now we will see they are stabilized, we will see an improvement and we are the major player there."
divislab,"What portion of this elevated inventory is relating to the high cost base, so that your process of blending with the low cost ones and managing your margin, so that process will continue?","most of the high cost procured material has been consumed, which has been reflected in the earlier quarters."
divislab,"Is it fair to understand that the elevated work in progress inventory that is to do with the kind of inventory rationalization that is going on industry wide largely for the APIs, is that the case?",I wouldn't generalize it as for the entire industry because each organization has their own strategy and way of taking these kind of decisions.
divislab,Whether the prices of carotenoid have also seen some impact because of the current situation?,"We have not seen any price pressures in the carotenoids. In fact, our plant of carotenoids is running in the 90-95% capacity. In fact, we needed more capacity of the API of carotenoids that is where, at Unit-3, we are putting additional capacity of carotenoids which will come in line sometime in the Q1-Q2 of next year."
divislab,"Carotenoid is not witnessing any kind of pricing pressure and you are operating at a kind of optimal utilization anyway, so with the input price correction, this is one segment which has seen the best improvement in terms of margin and spreads?","Now the import prices coming down need not be carotenoid raw materials because most of the carotenoid raw materials we make it ourselves, we start from the basic materials like ethylene, propylene, ethylene, including.... now we are putting a plant of ethylene production itself. So there we are very strong with base materials. That is not an impact based on the imported raw material. Now, as I mentioned that we are installing additional capacities in Unit-3, it indicates that the demand is much more than right now what we can do. I am not saying there are no competitors, I think we have enough business to expand and needed more capacity."
divislab,"So my first question is, in FY23 we have a gross block of about Rs. 6,800 crores and I presume this is just Unit-1 and 2, so wanted to get a sense of what is the broad range of peak sales that we can kind of generate with this gross block and range is okay with and we have different products and the asset turns will depend on what product mix we are making, so a broad range is fine?","Because we have a peculiar situation of projects of custom synthesis, projects of generic and nutraceutical, so some of them need more equipment which will give less value, like some of our 5000 tons of Naproxen or 3000 tons of Gabapentin, they may need large equipment, but at the same time some of the products we do in custom synthesis need a smaller equipment in volume cubic meter capacity, but that will yield higher production value. So it is difficult for us to say gross block, meter cube reactor capacity and so much of crores of business. I think it is very difficult and also in the last 5-8 years, we have started doing, as much as possible, automation and bringing a lot of instrumentation into the processes to bring safety, environment controls, all these add up into the gross block assets."
divislab,"Is the right way to look at asset turn, then by segment wise that given the instrument requirement is more in generics, would it be fair to look at what the asset turns could be for generics and what it could be for custom synthesis and if yes, could you share what the asset turns are by segment?","We cannot differentiate because we don't have blocks built for custom synthesis and buildings built for generics. We have buildings dedicated to type of chemistry like chlorination, hydrogenation, so different products go into different buildings for different stages of chemistry, but a product like Molnupiravir or Raltegravir where we have built production buildings as per the requirement of the customer; that is different, but usually that is not the case."
divislab,"I see for long periods of time you have been between 35% to 40% and in 2021 and 2022 you broke that and went to 40%-43%, so what is the steady state number that you all think you can achieve?","I think we used to be 35%-40% before the COVID and with the COVID up and down and when the COVID drug came, again it went up. So we see a stable probably a steady 30%, 35%-40%, I think that is what we can comfortably say."
divislab,"When should we see conversion of these products into revenue monetization based on the progress that you are seeing, would you say some of these start contributing in FY25-26, based on your assessment, what is the best guess in terms of conversion date of this pipeline?","I think I would like to say in general based on the strengths we have in sartans, based on the strengths we have in contrast media, we should be able to see a good growth in the coming year. I can't be specific on a product or a customer, and I am talking with reference to the big pharma only, contrast media or the sartans."
drreddy,"So, on a sequential basis, we have seen a significant uptick as well. Would you be able to give us some colour as to which were the primary driver, was it the acquisition, was it the Lenalidomide uptake in order of their quantum, if you can provide, even qualitatively would be very helpful?","Yes. So, this quarter, we had several growth engines. So, it's not just Lenalidomide. We grew market share in key products. This was, let's say, more than previous quarters. We saw relatively less price erosion that we normally do. We had the Mayne acquisition that contribute to that, and Lena. So, it's a combination of all of them. Even without Lena, it was a very healthy growth in the US."
drreddy,"I think across companies, there is now consensus that the price erosion has reduced. But do you see that, this reduced price erosion to continue for some time or is it more of a transitory phenomenon, which could kind of go away?","The model hasn't changed. So, in terms of price erosion, it's obviously a function of how many -- how much competition you got for your baseline on products that did not yet, if you wish, erode to the potential. So, I believe that in our case, we probably will see something similar also in the next coming quarters."
drreddy,"Can you elaborate a bit more, whether you're seeing a lot of supply opportunities emerging in the market due to problems at some of the competitors?","So it's a combination of timing of RFPs, combination of set of situation that happen to products in which we could supply more, not necessarily a supply shortage, but it could be service or other supply disruption situation that happens, and also activities that we did with certain customers as well. So overall, let's say, it's primarily volume-based growth that's based on the agreements that we have with customers."
drreddy,"So biosimilars, you mentioned. Can you talk about update in your global portfolio, which is for all the markets where you're focusing?","So biosimilars is a global initiative for us. We are planning to be in all the markets, including the United States with our portfolio. We are working on about 11 biosimilars, as we speak, in that -- some will be launched before 2030 and some after 2030, starting probably in the beginning of 2027."
drreddy,Can you just talk a bit more about what led to the growth seen in Russia and how sustainable this growth is?,"We -- in Russia, we grew, part of it is seasonal. We have most of our businesses in the retail, and we are also playing in the biosimilars. So, in this specific quarter, we enjoyed the seasonality of the allergy as part of it as well as the growth of the big brands there. We -- I believe that the growth momentum will be in Russia. In that respect, the combination of investing in our brands and enjoyed the growth momentum that comes from the relevant products that we have, plus a good defence on the ruble helped us to achieve these results."
drreddy,What is the kind of size that we would have seen this quarter out of that?,"So indeed, our base business did well even without Lenalidomide. Mayne, we closed the deal. In practical, it started to sell in the end of April. And we are actually launching product after product through this period of time. I believe that the main pickup will be in the next coming months, when customers will open their bids and we will be able to bid more."
drreddy,Is it fair to believe this is the kind of first year number and we should see a progressive improvement in the volume share going ahead?,"So, you know, we cannot share a specific number on these products. We are in agreements in which this volume..."
drreddy,"If I look at the number that we reported in fourth quarter and strip out the brand divestment, based on that, we've seen a pretty sharp increase on that base in the first quarter. I know you talked about a bunch of initiatives, but how should we look at growth in this business from the high single-digit that you pointed in your opening remarks?","The trade generic did not yet contribute much because we just recently launched it. And so, most of the growth happened from our branded generics, our key brands that we are focusing on. These trends are likely to continue also throughout the year and actually going to improve."
drreddy,We're seeing a lot of Dr. Reddy's name in terms of shortages of products in US. Are you seeing some opportunities meaningfully for us overcoming few quarters or are you planning to participate in some of them which could be potentially large for us?,"We do from time to time, but to be honest, I don't feel joy, when we are growing on the expense of others. I actually want the supply to be there for the patients. So, whenever it comes, we are taking it. But I don't see such a strategic growth lever. I'm happy to supply, if it helps patients, but actually wish that all the companies will be able to sell normally and not to see such a little growth, but it is coming to us as well from time to time."
drreddy,"And just on extending to your launch aspects or other two products if you'd like to call out, which would be interesting launches over the next 12 months to 15 months in North America segment?",I don't want to call out specifically. We're trying to avoid it because after that we have a lot of discussion on this product. But what we can say is that we believe that we can sustain also the level of activities in North America even post lenalidomide because we have quite a few of very high-value products if we can bring to the market.
eichermot,"can you talk about the divergence in margin performance versus the mix? So, we had lower share ofexports and higher share of Hunter, but still margins have improved quite substantially. What has driven this margin on a YoY or QoQ basis?","
So basically, margins have gone up about 1.5%, which is the impact of price hikes that we had taken on May 1, that is flowing through the margin. Apart from that, about 0.8% is on account of the savings in sourcing costs, which we talked about last quarter as well. And of course, the international mix is therefore weighing down, so that's essentially making up the overall growth in margin."
eichermot,"Is there anything related, which is causing the downward pressure there? ","It's a little bit of a timing issue as well because we don't really, I think our marketing campaigns, launch expenses have really not kicked into high in this particular quarter. And we've also had a little bit of travel expenses, which are a little bit muted right now."
eichermot,"If you can just help us understand how are we doing on the whole non-vehicle ambit, which is basically our accessories or spare parts revenue, all of that?","In this quarter, it has almost about 25% growth compared to last year, and it has been growing very well. Our accessories, we are adding SKUs more. Our accessories actually for the existing motorcycles, anyway it is during the consumer journey, it goes through the MiY page. And then he can configure that against styling, safety, comfort, that's what the vertical which we give it in the motorcycle accessories. But also for the motorcycles which were sold about three years back, all the old motorcycles for that also we brought in a configurator where the consumer can actually build the motorcycle accessories even in his motorcycle. And to order that that is also enabled and that is also working. At our service area also, we are opening. Spare parts, we are looking at more than in a revenue stream, which is very good incidentally, we look at it from a consumer satisfaction angle, Pramod, because we always look at even the last washer, it should be available at any point of time at any place when it is required."
eichermot,can you also talk about the cost outlook and how much price increase we have taken in the second quarter?,"Yes. So, I think we don't necessarily talk about our cost outlook per se. But I think in the first quarter, we have taken about a 1.5% price increase in certain models, the impact of which will flow into the second quarter."
eichermot,"When can we expect the next motorcycle like Bullet 350 and all, because the media reports that it is supposed to be in August end or something. So, can you give some sense on the near-term launches? At least the timeline?","Here and now Bullet we have sent you, the media invite and block the dates and all, so that launch is now planned. My mind is fully on that, how we celebrate and enjoy the Bullet's legacy and what it has brought us here. But as Siddharth was mentioning, we have a slew ofnew products in all the categories, which we are working on. We will come with more and more new products, and we'll give you the details when we are coming closer to the launches, Hitesh."
eichermot,"irstly, on exports, you guys talked about the macro weakness that's impacted the volumes. 1\vo-part question essentially, how we should then think of the full-year FY24 outlook for exports. And beyond the near-term also, if! have to think about exports, I mean where does the growth come from? Is it market share? Is it category expansion? How should I think about it?","Market share, it's a derivative Gunjan to be honest, because we normally don't look at only the market share. But in a market which is already existing, and our brand is getting accepted more and more, I can't give you a direct answer of where exactly the numbers ofinternational markets will be. But I will tell you where the brand love is. I think I mentioned to you also that we were looking at a rider community in Europe. It's almost about some 17,000, 18,000 people signed up for it. So that's the product love, which is coming up and the brand love coming in. And we have, mind you, we have only about 1,000 retail outlets as of now outside India and there is a huge potential, which is there for us to grow. But we are not doing just like that, because we have to take the macro conditions of the particular market now. We have to be careful about not loading the dealers. So, we wanted to do it in a systematic form, so that the ecosystem is also profitable. So, we are slowly opening up, and there are enough prospects which are cleared up for all the markets. So, the reach is going to be one major lever for the international markets in time to come. And all the new products which are going to come one after the other, because Royal Enfield nowadays are making only the global products. It is not country-specific like earlier times. All those products also will create their own category in that market."
eichermot,"Great scale up that we've seen in the last one year. And I mean, I remember maybe the last conference call or prior when you had mentioned that there's a lot more opportunity for Hunter to still scale up, given that the volumes are now at 16k-17k units a month. Do you still see there are some gaps where this model can scale up from the current run rate to say, 20k-25k. I mean I'm not trying to get a number, but directionally trying to understand the potential ofthis model from where it is right now? Or you think it's matured?","Look, I think for a product, one can't send it has come to the maturity level, Gunjan. Obviously, I'm not going to give you the number exactly as you said. But I'll tell you directionally. Hunter, what is this product, once again, to give a clarity to everyone is that people love the Royal Enfield brand. They wanted a product which is a bit more different and agile, and it should be nimble, and he can relate to the product. And compared to the other products it can be slightly at a lower weight. That's where we thought that we should bring it to the younger audience. And what we wanted from that product exactly is what it landed into the hands ofconsumers. And that's why I mentioned when the metros started taking young guys, now the rural areas are also now started taking on the Hunter. International market, not that the Hunter is available in all the markets, even in a few markets, we are just opening up. So, the Hunter as a franchise overall is growing for Royal Enfield. We see there's a huge potential for the Hunter in time to come."
eichermot,he sale ofabove 250cc motorcycles has increased to 8% of industry versus 2%-3% 10 years ago. How would the share increase over the medium to long-term? Andwhat would be the share ifyou take the top 10 cities or some ofthe urbanized states?,"So as we mentioned in an absolute number, let us go through it. It is from 50,000 at one point of time to almost a million motorcycles. That's the growth over the decade. From here where do we see it, our understanding is that there are enough disruptions, which are taking place. But especially ICE vehicles in the premium segment, it is going to continue to grow. In that growth, the overall volume will grow and because we have enough new products, which are coming in and our own activities which we are doing and working with the community, we'll also see our numbers going up"
eichermot,ny specific on how is the U.S. marketperforming for us as it's been one ofthe largest markets? ,"We are taking on our own the entire market activity, development activities from the distributor. Directly, we are going to do that, signing up the dealers. So that's also a transition which is taking place. In all those markets, as ofnow, the market is not growing. It is slightly opening up, that's where it is. But the good thing which is happening is as the retails are better. Our market share, we are marginally gaining or holding on to the market share. So, we are not losing out on anything. In my understanding, some of the markets will open up in another about five, six months' time. That's where I see it will open up. It's only once again, readings and personal understanding of this. There's no signs to say that this country will open up by this particular point of time. So, we will only be looking at consciously loading into those markets. But we have a lot ofnew products which are going to come and that new products are going to get us new consumer eyeballs into those. And that's how we are seeing, there is a huge growth potential which is possible for us. We have almost 1,000 retail outlets outside India. We are focusing on increasing those retail outlets in all the markets, but we will not rush ourselves. We will go systematically, because we always look at it, it has to be credible over a period oftime that shouldbe a pull brand."
eichermot,"See, the waiting times on all your models range from one month to six months. What is the cause for that? Are we rurming overcapacity? Or how do you see it? Is there a shortage ofparts?","Not really, Ritesh. What happens is every product when we come out with a business case, vis-a-vis what is the market acceptance and numbers, all our products have positively surprised us in a way. So, we have put something as a capacity, and then we started looking at it. The market response has been very good. So, there is a lead time, which is required to come back and then give that extra need, which is there in the market. So that's the capital which we have to keep putting it in product-after-product. Most of our products are as of now, about three, four weeks times and barring a few products for which also we have already started the action. So that will take care ofthe supply situation for those products."
grasim,"So, if you can give detail which all areas we are seeing cost dictation? ","So, on the first side, obviously, the main cost items where we have seen reduction are pulp prices, caustic prices and coal prices. So, all the important input prices have come down compared to last year significantly and also compared to the last quarter. So, that is a very positive trend. Looks like the input prices do not have much further room to go down, but we have to see. It all depends on the macro level situation and especially in China. So, China now is going through very difficult phase. Today newspapers everybody read that China is going through deflationary pressure. So, we have to see how the government and the Chinese economy perform in the coming months and that will determine the input prices all over the world."
grasim,"for the Paint division, should we expect a large part of our ₹10,000 crore CAPEX to be concluded by FY’25 given that FY’24 also is a very significant CAPEX for the presentation?","Yes. So, you can assume that. So, a large part of CAPEX will be done by FY’25."
grasim,"the B2B ecommerce, there is low CAPEX what we are spending this year, is there any other indirect way of financing in terms of working capital etc., being absorbed in that business?","No, there is no in that as of now I think and CAPEX is, see, it is not a CAPEX intensive business. We have spent on the technology side, and of course, we will have to continue to spend on technology. So, that is all for CAPEX."
grasim,"the peak of CAPEX will be this intensity only in a particular year or coming years FY’25, '26 you see further increasing CAPEX from what we are spending in FY’24?","So, for the Board approved CAPEX numbers, if you look, this is I think one of the highest spending year, current financial year. For the next financial year, we will have while the pending CAPEX of Paints business for the next financial year, we will have proposals to go to the Board and get Board approval etc. So, for next financial year, it is very difficult to say about the numbers, but as of now, yes, this year looks like CAPEX heavy year."
grasim,"if we see our ECU realizations in Q1, they have been far better than the other players' reported numbers in the caustic chlorine division. So, just wanted to have your thoughts here that was there any specific reason for our ECU realizations higher than our peers?","So, I think the reason is that, I think, tactically, we played couple of moves better than some of our competitors. From a long term, if you say, was there any strategic shift? No, I think the difference was that our back, what we call our chlorine derivatives compared to Q4 of last year to Q1 of this year, our volumes have materially gone up. And other than that, it was, I guess, more day-to-day active management."
grasim,what proportion flakes forms in terms of our total sales volumes for caustic soda division?,"So, flakes form to the tune of around 20% to 25% of our total caustic line production."
grasim,"assuming that there is a further fall or a downslide in India prices, will margins hold at these levels because your pulp prices and caustic prices is going down further or you can see some directionally, some pressure on margins in the coming quarters on VSF?","Yes, you have summed up it almost correctly. So, there will be some pressure, but it is all very marginal. There are not big movements either way. So, yes, prices, the international prices have reduced since end of June, and we also have to follow that trend in India also, and there is some reduction in the raw material prices also, but everything moves. There are so many moving parts, and we have a pipeline in the transit of raw materials and all these things. So, there will be small difference whatever way it is, yes."
grasim,"I mean, give or take few basis points here or there, but these margins are largely bottomed out?","We would like to think so. Yes. And you never know. You know, there are always surprises from China or sometimes Europe like the things change so fast. Within one-month things can change. Global sentiments can change. Anything that happens has its effect on everything, but largely, yes"
grasim,"recently, there were some news articles about spinning mills like seeing some shutdown or temporary closure in Tamil Nadu or the textile hubs, so does that impact our volume outlook in any way?","See, globally textile markets are not doing great including in India and not just in viscose, but across all kinds of products, all kind of things, whether it is cotton or polyester or linen or viscose. So, this is a global trend and exports from India have also declined Q-o-Q also and Y- o-Y also. So, everything is under a little bit of slow down."
grasim,"So, there can be some hit on volumes is what you say from the current quarter like we did a pretty healthy utilization of (+90%). So, are we expecting some fall?
","Yes, we are trying our best to maintain the volumes and also try to get more volume in export market. So, we try to maintain our volume as best as possible."
hcltech,"Just curious about how you're seeing this playing out in the marketplace in contracts. Given you have a high participation in some of the cost takeout deals, maybe on the cloud side,
is this showing up in discussions as a source of price deflation that maybe you or competitors are driving and hence might impact your contract profitability going forward?","I don't see anyone trying to take the contractual position of how much we have to deliver through this technology because there are too many dependencies. So I think, there is definitely a lot of hype in the short run, but we do believe it will have some meaningful benefits in the long run."
hcltech,"what is the kind of a tailwind that you'll get from profitability through possibly, change in the compensation revision cycle for this year?","I don't want to really talk numbers on that, but E4 and above is a significant portion of the wage bill. I don't want to get into exact numbers, but like I said at the press conference also - we have made a plan. We have revised that plan based on the numbers that we see for Q1. Obviously, we have revised it by baking in more actions and more cost cutbacks that we need to do. I think, the leadership team is all apprised of the situation. The numbers gap is obviously visible to all of us and everybody. I think as a leadership team, we are committed that we will take the actions to meet the numbers."
hcltech,"what was the one-time benefit in the intangible
amortization? Is it worth, how much basis point in this quarter and will it reverse in the second
quarter?","No, so it will certainly not reverse in the second quarter. It is a one-time benefit. This is the
impairment, we had taken a couple of years back in one of the products. And the product has
done well in the last two years, and we have been able to increase the royalty we get on that. So
the revenues are significantly up; therefore, as per the accounting rules, we needed to write it
back - write the impairment back. So, it's just a one-time benefit in this quarter and there are no
repercussions on any of the next subsequent quarters."
hcltech,what type of orders are we taking into ER&D segment?,"We are seeing two kinds. One is
consolidation in each of the Tech and Telecom segments. We are seeing more consolidation
deals, and hence a pipeline that is growing. To what CVK said earlier, that is helping us gain
more confidence that, when these deals fructify, realization to revenue will be quicker. So that's
one we are seeing that consolidation is on. The second we are seeing is decision-making, which
used to be reasonable, is getting a little delayed. Those are two trends we are seeing in terms of
pipeline and order booking"
hcltech,"While my question on the ER&D outlook essentially has been
answered, just wanted to understand, your hiring plans in the backdrop of some of the near-term
challenges that you've seen?","I think our hiring plans, quarter-on-quarter, we do moderate our plans to be in line with our
forecast for the quarter, the revenue forecast for the quarter. Next quarter is typically the quarter,
where the fresher intake will be higher. So that will continue as planned. So, basis that, we will
moderate our requirements for lateral hires."
hcltech,"last quarter you had shared that the ACV for the year was plus 4% year over year. What is
it on a TTM basis at the end of 1Q?","I don't have a number on a TTM basis, but for the quarter, it is 21% lower year-on-
year."
hcltech,"is it any different from a sub-vertical perspective or this
is an overall thought process that you see?","No, the Tech and Telecom part of our ER&D business, which got impacted quite a bit, like we've
been talking about, those we see conversion and we see back to growth situation in it."
hcltech,"CVK, the question is around the verticals of Tech and
Telecom. You talked about uncertainty. So, was this largely deferrals or some cancellations, and
are these behind us, or you think this will continue to be an issue in the near term","From all what we are seeing, we think it is stabilized, but this has been so volatile, so I won't be
able to give you more color on that. It looks like these are stabilized."
hcltech,"Is this what you were
anticipating given that you've maintained the guidance and also if you could characterize the
enterprise tech spend environment, despite seasonality and the strong deal wins that you had in
the past?","it came in lower
than our own expectations. While all the large deals that we won, we really executed extremely
well. They all ramped up. They've all delivered good revenue growth as you can see in both Life
Sciences and Manufacturing verticals. And even in Financial services we've seen good growth.
Tech and telecom is where we saw more drops than what we had expected and we were
expecting some projects to go online, but towards the second half of the quarters, that did not
happen. So we did have people, we were ready and they did not really move forward. There
were a couple of instances, one Tech and Telecom. So it was disappointing for us to have that
situation, which not only declined our revenue, but it also had a big impact on our margins."
hcltech,"Just the clarity in terms of the guidance, CVK, so do
you believe the 2Q conversion of deal pipeline into deal wins will also result into a better growth
from 2Q onwards, or do you expect the growth to pick up from 3Q?","That was the commentary that I made even when we
presented the guidance. So, you should see incrementally better growth and obviously, this
means there's going to be spike in one of the quarters. So that's to be expected."
hdfcbank,"So somehow I feel on an incremental basis for the quarter, you might have lost a lot amount of market share, anything specific which affected this quarter's deposit mobilization?","There is nothing specific as such. Typically Q1 is of all the quarters is a slow quarter. Across various parameters, it's a slow quarter. So some of these factors typically contribute, but then more important is that we're confident that the building blocks that we put in place for such enormous growth remain, and confident of getting that to fruition over the next few quarters."
hdfcbank,"But apparently in the call, this time, you said it's actually grown at 18.5%. That is if I just take the retail HDFC and add the gross advances of the stand-alone entity, the number is 18.5%. What number to go by?","See, the gross bank, we put that up on page 23 of the earnings deck that we published earlier today to be helpful on that. The bank’s gross of IBPC grew by 20%. And HDFC's individual loans, the mortgage individual loans grew by 14% year-on-year. So combined just the bank loan and the individual loans because that's, these are the categories of loans that are managed for significant opportunities and growth. That's grown at 19%, 18.7%. That's a growth."
hdfcbank,"Are you confident that on a merged basis, when you deliver the September quarter results, you can sustain the current levels of ROA reported?","Yes, the level of confidence is pretty high. Typically, I think, Sashi had alluded to in some other context that we're looking at 1.9 to 2.1. That's the range at which we'll oscillate. Quarter- to-quarter, if there is a timing on certain things, particularly if there is anything that we do, we’ll be timing, but otherwise, broadly it is the 1.9 to 2.1 that he alluded to before. That is where we are confident of driving to deliver."
hdfcbank,"So the merge balance sheet has grown 13% after including everything and if you exclude IBPC then it's grown 16%. So do we -- can we see a 17%, 18% growth as we end the year? ","See, if you think about any time period, a three-year period or a five-year period typically, which we look at 2.3x, 2.4x it moves up, which indicates about 17%, 18% kind of a growth. And that's over a period of a longer term, five, three, five years' time period. But over a shorter time period, yes, somewhere we have done 15%, 16%, somewhere we have done 18%, 19%, but 17%, 18% is the kind of, our capacities are built and that is how we are gaining traction to be at that level from a consistency of growth point of view."
hdfcbank,"Would you be able to quantify the CRR and SLR of Limited, HDFC limited at the end of June?","No, see the, it starts to kick-in, I think in the next fortnight, it would start to kick-in. And we provided you the high level in terms of how we're carrying liquidity to both, to support the growth and support all the results that are required."
hdfcbank,"Obviously, Q1 has some kind of a seasonality. But given the capacities which are being built and the investment in franchise which is being done, what is the average kind of a retail deposit accretion which we can see over next six to eight-odd quarters?","what we feel, we don't give one forward looking statement, but at least I want to indicate what we have previously said, which is yes, we have built capacities to be at that kind of a level and that is where, that is when you look at it over a period of time, yes, there has been a quarter where it is lower. Again, there are seasonality, it is low, because there are times in this April to June quarter, where typically it is low because people are away, customers are away, schools are out, many things happen in this quarter. And, but our goal and our drive is to be at that kind of a level that we previously indicated, and this will come back up and where we try to drive that forward."
hdfcbank,"So INR1 trillion was the indication, so we should drive that back to INR1 trillion-odd level?","Yes, thereabouts, that's what we had indicated that that's the level at which we'd like to operate."
hdfcbank,And one last question in terms of any integration cost that would be incurred once there is a merger or there is no integration cost?,"No, there will be integration cost in the form of stamp duties and in the form of certain other costs that we will have. But they are, as we said, within reason, nothing substantial, but within reason it will be. We will call that out separately after we complete it."
hdfcbank,"So this quarter, quarter-on-quarter, your interest costs are up quite sharply, 15%. So can you help us understand where you are in terms of your term deposit rates on balance sheet versus incremental?","yes, if you look at the deposit pricing over a period of time, the SA deposits haven't moved, as you know, not just for us, in the entire market it is what it is. It is the time deposit. "
hdfcbank,Are you able to still quantify the crystallized liabilities of HDFC Limited at the time of the merger?,"Yes, the liabilities that get crystallized about INR6,36,000 crores is what is moved to the bank, that INR6,36,000 includes the deposits, which is on page 23 of the earnings deck that we showed. That includes the deposit, but INR6,36,000 crores is what is moved along with the assets."
hdfclife,"You and I-Pru have seen a good pickup in protection, so just wanted to ask how sustainable this pickup looks? What are the factors driving this now?","There are multiple elements because of which we are seeing an uptick in protection. First, we see customer demand, which we believe will be sustainable. We see this demand in HDFC Life web search, which is happening in terms of protection. The second piece is that we are now looking at higher activation of our frontline sales across all geographies in a very calibrated and product- centric approach."
hdfclife,"The broker channel has seen a doubling of the share of term. Does that include online players?
","That is right. Some of the players like PolicyBazaar are now moved from a web aggregator to a broking code. So they are reflected under the Broker channel.
"
hdfclife,"if you go back to the last call, what you have been saying is that because of the merger of the parent, the share you will end the year or you aspire to end the year at is 70% wallet share. This is a very big move from where we were last year. So obviously, you started moving in that direction this quarter, small changes in Q1, as you mentioned. What's the big change that will happen on ground for you? And do you see that playing out to up to 70%? Or it will be a little more gradual?","I'll add on to what Vibha mentioned in the first answer to Suresh. We have seen a slight increase of 0.5% to 1% in terms of our market share increase at HDFC Bank. But to your point, I think it will be gradual because it is going to be calibrated both at the Bank level as well as at our level."
hdfclife,And the second question is on EoM regulations. How do you see the commission levels? Is there some commission pressure? And how is the competitive landscape on the distribution side changing because of this?,"The reason the regulator has given us this flexibility is to say that you guys have been around for a while, please behave responsibly. And we would want to respect that ethos and not say that just because you can do much higher levels, it will be done irresponsibly.
What we might do is that some activities, which were paid for separately to the distributor, now we pay it as a fully loaded commission and tell the distributor or the partner that you guys can run those activities for us as customer outreach. Hence, I don't see any impact on the customer or the organization."
hdfclife,"We can see that in individual APE, the share of bancassurance has gone up significantly, in fact, the overall growth in bancassurance is pretty high. So how should we read this?","Nischint, Suresh, here. 3-4 points on this. One, of course, HDFC Bank has seen a fairly good growth this quarter as compared to last year. At an overall level, while our market share has inched up, they have shown fairly good growth. Second, we have obviously been supported by a lot of other large partners, whether it's YES Bank, IDFC Bank or Bandhan bank. Multiple such large partners, including many of the SFBs where we have a very strong presence, who have also helped us grow. It's not that our proprietary has not grown. Our agency business continues to do well and has also grown fairly well."
hdfclife,What kind of an impact it could probably have on the margins for you?,"On group savings, it is not hugely margin accretive. The reason we are in this business is more in terms of relationships and being in the market."
hdfclife,"if you could comment on the segmental margins in the non-par business, given the fact that some of these products have to be repriced?","It is accretive but not hugely accretive. I would say that it gives more as a bulk than anything else. And it tends to be lumpy. You are in discussions for a long time with a particular corporate or PSU and then it comes through or they have shifted from one insurer to the other. So, it tends to be seasonal. It is good, but I would not read too much into it from a margin perspective."
hdfclife,And on the segmental margins in the non-par?,"Margins are fairly similar compared to what we've had in the past, adjusting for this gap in the growth that we spoke about earlier on the call. At very high-ticket sizes, of course, volume has been impacted to some extent as expected, but it's been more than made up by the growth in the other ticket sizes where at an overall level, the average ticket size has been maintained for the segment. As a consequence of that, margins are more or less where they were earlier. There are competitive pressures as you can expect in all categories, including this one. But, we've been maintaining our pricing discipline by and large, over the period since we launched this product category, and there could be maybe a lag of a month in terms of getting back to the pricing levels that you would like, but we've been fairly disciplined about that to be able to achieve this."
hdfclife,"It's a known fact that our cost associated with HDFC Bank is relatively on the higher side. Now given the relationship changes between parent and child, then do we expect that the cost what we pay to HDFC Bank will still remain at those levels?","I think these kinds of conversations are more for the Bank. But when the Bank says parent and child, I think it subsumes many such big and small things, which will come out of these discussions, which are happening at a very regular basis. But I think it will happen because for them also to switch hats from being a Bank to a conglomerate is not even a month old."
hdfclife,have the Bank people have started sitting on the board? I just wanted to understand when the board constitution will change so that we have people from bank sitting in the Board.,"Renu Karnad, who has been the HDFC Limited nominee, today was her last day at this AGM. Her tenure is not getting renewed for now. Some of these changes are not very far off in terms of somebody from the Bank’s end coming on to our Board.
"
heromotoco,We have seen very strong bookings clearly. Can you just talk about what is the expected supply and why the bookings have been stopped currently?,"so the booking stoppage is part of the plan, the whole marketing sales strategy around it and it’s all part of that plan in terms of online booking having stopped for that. We will open the window very soon because we do want the first set of this 25,000 customers to experience the motorcycle, to experience the test ride, for them to become our brand ambassadors and of course we know that a lot of customers have been demanding for bookings to be reopened, we will soon reopen the bookings as well. "
heromotoco,And anything on the milestones for deciding further models under Harley Hero partnership?,"as you know that the model that we have launched and the segment that we have launched is one of the biggest segments in the premium, both from the revenue point of view as well as profit pool point of view. So we are focusing fully on this model as of now. But obviously there is a thinking in future to extend the portfolio and also to look at geographies, but those are discussions that we will have with our partner Harley-Davidson at an appropriate point in time."
heromotoco,"is there a breakeven level of EV volumes that we have, at which this drag will start to reduce?","As volumes go up, of course there will be economies as well, in terms of the scale economies we will get, and then a cost reduction, there is localization happening, both the factors will come into play and therefore cash burn per unit actually is going to come down in the industry if you take two, three quarters away from now. So that is what industry is working on. So it is not going to be like proportionate to that the cash burn amounts and all that will go up."
heromotoco,"Can you kindly talk about the spare sales in the quarter, what level it was and secondly why did realization?","We have been able to clock a net revenue of ₹1,210 Crores which is a growth of 14% and of course it contributes to about 14% of the revenue. What I just wanted to say is, this is a really a very good strategy and execution of the pivot that we have taken towards expansion of availability, because really what you need is in the aftermarket availability at arms length and we were able to get that. The second thing that we are doing is also adding new lines of business. So whether it is tyres or oil, there is a lot of new business that is coming in and our parts distributors and our super stockists are embracing this new way.
"
heromotoco,"So would it be fair to say that the inventory levels are lower than where they were say 6 months back, like what is the kind of inventory levels that we are looking at right now, if you can help us quantify that number?","Typically, and that is we have always given that in terms of how we look at in terms of the future. Well currently, we manage it between 6-7 weeks that’s range that we are at. We are at 6 weeks currently and that is something that is very well positioned for the festival season as we start building it up."
heromotoco,"So is there a part of it which is also because of the FAME subsidy removal or is it just a normal general investment on the EV side and where does this costs sit, if you can help us understand, like is it because the other expenses have gone up earlier are come down now. So if you can help us understand where are you, where this cost related to EV sit?","It is more on the gross margin side because we did not have a past sale, so we did not have any one-off like the other players on the subsidy withdrawal. But of course the subsidiary withdrawal has impact on the unit gross margin which is overall underlying, some price increase and some margin hit which is there. As we have guided already that around 100 bps is the investment that goes into the combination of all the cash burn that happens."
heromotoco,Is that just the mix impact as economic segment has seen a good recovery on Q-o-Q basis or there is something else also?,"It is a combination of a bit of time lag on the cost and also mix, but overall if you look at it on the trend basis which is year-on-year basis in terms of our gross margin, that remains healthy. But you are right, it is the combination of those two which moves between quarter to quarter. Overall it is something which is in a position year on year basis at a reasonably steady level."
heromotoco,"So I mean given we entered with VIDA in December and now we are in scale up mode, so how do we see scale up of VIDA over FY24?","So yes, as you heard we had announced that starting with the three cities from last year, we will be going to 100 cities this year. We are already at 36 cities and we will, well before the end of the calendar year, we will be reaching 100 cities and you all aware that we are coming out with 3 formats"
heromotoco,My second question is if you can share some thoughts on how you are seeing the urban versus rural demand in the recent month and what is the expectation for the festive season?,"Urban continues to be a strong driver and we see good momentum out there. As far as rural is concerned, I think there are some very good indications that we have got, already Niranjan has covered that - whether it is the capex that drives the income in the hands of the people, the rains that have been spread across the country and therefore how coming forward as we look to the festival season. We have seen some green shoots, as we see Super Splendor moving in, as we see Passion coming in, these are products that have a very good balance across the country."
heromotoco,"So the second question is with regard to the prolonged government agency inquiries which are happening. As shareholders, do we need to know you have to make any provisions or impact for the taxes or any of those matter? Second, whatever policy corrective actions you plan to take so that such things do not repeat?","So as far as we are concerned, we have given the commentary in the accounts as well, that we do not see a need for making any provision and whatever the information that is required by various authorities, the company continues to provide and cooperate with the authorities on this matter."
hindalco,"First on the Bay Minette cost inflation. In the last quarter’s call, we had mentioned that we are expecting some support under the US Inflation Reduction Act. Any update on that, given that we have about $200 million to $300 million of cost inflation, will it be offset by that or it will be fresh out flow?","Sure. Not a large update. We have filed our requests under 48C. We will not have clarity as to any allocations towards either the Bay Minette project or Guthrie recycling project until probably the end of this fiscal year, that is March of 2024. And in the new Capex range of 2.7 billion to 2.8 billion for Bay Minette, it does not include any such funds that we might get allocated for this project."
hindalco,"So, we have seen global coal prices falling much sharply versus our coal cost being largely stable other than e-auction coal prices. So, in that respect and with other cost deflation, what kind of cost reduction, do we expect in 2Q and where does that put us in the global cost curve for aluminum?","So, Q1 to Q4, cost came down by about 2% and Q2 to Q1, we expect to come down by a further 3%. So, most of the coal that we have been buying in the last few months, we have started to see quite a good reduction in coal prices. So, we are quite encouraged now, and we think that Q2 overall Costs is expected to go down by 3% from Q1 FY24. Now where we are on the cost front, Hindalco is very firmly in the left hand side of the first quartile. I mean if you look at our EBITDA margin of 24% in the aluminum business compared to most of our peers who have already declared, you will see that our EBITDA margins are much better than most of them."
hindalco,if you could share what was it in 1Q and how do we see it changing in the coming quarters?,"in Q1, our linkage was 41% and the e-auction was 53%. In Q2, we think that the linkage coal utilization is going to be like 57% to 60% range , which is why we are guiding that we will be cost wise down another 3% sequentially"
hindalco,"And also on the cost front, if you see international thermal coal prices back to almost two-year low versus what we are kind of guiding for next quarter when maybe on a normalized basis is still much higher versus what we were say two years ago or three years ago before the Covid era?","you have to remember went up much, much more than what domestic prices went up. International prices had gone up to $240 per ton. They have since moderated down, but it's still quite patchy."
hindalco,Is there a significant mix change in coal and change in the cost of linkage coal as well?,"You're right, are still a couple of Rs. 100 per million kilocal higher than what they were pre Covid. Now I personally believe that it's only after the captive mines that most of us in the steel and aluminum industry have got, once our captive mine starts, then only you will see the coal cost going back to those early levels. I think as long as we are participating in auctions, you are going to see ups and downs. Structurally, the this cost shall change when our own mines starts in the coming years."
hindalco,"Yes, sir. Sir, in terms of linkage coal, given that we participated in the auction, it is the cost which is getting consumed, now is very different from what it was 2-3 years back, is the premiums elevated as well?","It's not very different, but it is higher. 2-3 years ago what we got in linkage and today compared to what we have gone through in the last few quarters is much lower. But if I compare it to three years ago, it is higher. And you have to remember that generally in India there is at least a 6% inflation in Coal India notified price every year anyway."
hindalco,"what would be your, so you said 60% odd linkage from next quarter. Is that a normalized level or we'll see further increase in linkage proportion in coming quarters?","I don't think so. I think that normally 60% is what our linkages are like because you have to remember these linkages are a rolling phenomenon. So, older ones get finished, new linkages starts, so that keeps going. So, if you go back and look, I think generally the best we have done is about 60-62% in a quarter."
hindalco,"any update you would like to share on our coal mine, captive coal mines like Chakla and Meenakshi, where are we?","So, no real change. Chakla mine continues to move ahead as our plan. I think we have a box cut planned in FY25. That is next year somewhere in October. Meenakshi, we are still hoping for Meenakshi allotment, but maybe it is the time to tell you that last week we participated in Meenakshi West Coal mine , which is just sort of West of the existing Meenakshi mine and we won that as well."
hindalco,Which approvals are pending and what's the latest timeline we are seeing?,"So, we are still hoping to get the Meenakshi mine allocated, but we have a Plan B which is Meenakshi West that we won last week, which is another six to seven million tons per year coal capacity. So, at least, we are adequately covered and hopefully we can start Meenakshi West if this Meenakshi does not get allocated going forward."
hindalco,"So, what is the reason for this delay in allocation? Because we're seeing this across many companies?","There is a fundamental regulatory issue related to what they call land acquired under the Coal Bearing Act. So, to allocate a mine to a private industry besides the subsurface rights, you will have to allocate the land as well to a private Company and the law did not really allow the CBA land to be transferred from a public sector unit to a private. So, the government has had to deal with that regulatory aspect. That's why many mines are stuck on this. But I think it's getting resolved now.
"
hindunilvr,"So here, my specific question is, in terms of the palm oil inventory, would you be a bit more in terms of the pricing versus, say, some of the other players?","Yes. So, both elements, element of (A) price actions in Skin Cleansing, (B) dialing up A&P in Skin Cleansing and equally dialing up investments behind other categories within Beauty & Personal Care. And you've seen the impacts of those. For example, we grew in double-digit Skin Care and Color cosmetics. We had good volume growth in Hair Care, Oral Care, and those are the examples where the investments that we have done in A&P across BPC categories, we are seeing impact of it coming in. "
hindunilvr,"And second is when you see the recovery in the Oral Care versus some of your other Personal Care business, is there any difference in terms of the consumer behavior, which is driving this?","Oral Care as a category you can imagine is a highly penetrated category. Of course, there's a job to be done in terms of increasing the brushing occasion. That's a long longer-term job to be done. But the overall price value equation, the kind of distribution that we have done and the innovation activation put together, we have seen Close up basically driving the growth of Oral Care overall for us."
hindunilvr,"So HUL is a very well-run company. But in the last few months that you have spent here, where do you think there are still some gaps that you want, that you've identified and you want to work on from a next 12-month perspective? ","So, to your question, I have now been immersed last few months, as a designator, in the business meeting different customers. Our teams also the branches, and I've been to a factory or two. So, I have a sense of really how the business is and seen the impact on the ground. So by and large, I would say we have a fundamentally a very strong business that's well poised for growth in the long-term story of India, and we have very strong positions and we should be able to leverage and exploit that to grow our company to the next level and doing that by fulfilling our mission of what's good for India is good for HUL."
hindunilvr,"And second, one quick very small question on other expenses, Ritesh while you mentioned 20% and royalty impact despite that, is there any one-off setting in that number, Ritesh?","Yes. So, we did have one-off in the base period, Vivek, hence year-on-year when look at it, you will see the impact of coming in. If you look at sequentially what we had a number of other expenses in the previous quarter, March quarter, is very similar. But apart from that and impact on the base of one-off explains by and large, what has changed year-on-year basis on that line."
hindunilvr,"One of the things I wanted to sort of put forth to you is the Skin Cleansing portfolio. I mean, if I look at it over a fairly long period of time, like around 15 years or so, there has been significant market share erosion in this. So just wanted to understand, I mean, what is the reason why this has happened?","Skin Cleansing, we did call out Percy. Yes, if I look at last more than a decade, our shares are lower compared to what it was at we say a decade or 15 years ago. Some parts of that have been portfolio choices, where a part of the segment, which was not making profit and at the lower end, we did vacate that part. That was one reason. There were also competitive reason where we lost shares in the initial part of the decade and we had called out. The learnings we had were two. Number one, product superiority; and number two, dialing up the rigor of Winning in Many Indias."
hindunilvr,"My second question is a little bit more on the near term. So, you mentioned in your PPT that soon the pricing growth will become flat or even negative on a Y-o-Y basis. So, in light of this, how do you see the volume responding? ","This quarter, as we speak, market grew volume in mid-single digit. Same period last year, market had declined volumes by 6 percentage. And hence, one of the things we spoke on the chart when you look at a 2-year number, CAGR market volumes are roughly flat over 2 years. As far as HUL is concerned, we had 6% volume growth in period last year and a further 3% growth this year. So over 2 years, we've grown a 5 percentage of our volumes."
hindunilvr,"If Rohit from your global experience actually, when a country or a geography which you cover, moves from, let's say, significant inflation to lesser inflation to, let's say, deflation or rather lower inflation. So how do you manage the P&L?","We are, at the moment, specifically focused on driving competitive volume growth. That at one level is on the top line job. And at the bottom line, we do have tailwind of reducing commodity costs. Some of that we are passing in higher A&P investments. We want to keep our brands strong, penetration is growing. And we do have our productivity program Symphony to drive the savings."
hindunilvr,And also in Laundry specifically and Tea does it really affect the lower end of your portfolio?,"In nowhere else across the portfolio, we have seen downgrading happening. The point as mentioned quite a few times earlier, we did see consumers seeking value and either uptrading or downtrading, but we’re not seeing downgrading happening."
hindunilvr,Can you give a perspective on whether there's any change in your reading of what's happening on the ground on rural? ,"So rural, as you called out for the last few quarters that slowdown has bottomed out. And indeed, this time, in fact, we did not repeat that comment because we also spoke hard numbers as well. Let me summarize 3 or 4 elements, Richard, in rural. First, we had seen in these last few last quarter, year, year and a half, double-digit volume decline of the rural market. And from that space, as we spoke in the latest quarter, market for rural has turned positive and say market was 2% up. Still job to be done. If I look at 2 years CAGR, rural has a 4% circa 4% volume decline, but it is definitely looking up compared to what it was."
hindunilvr,And the third one is around rural and whether our optimism on rural recovery is lower versus what it was a quarter ago given the weather risks. ,"Now coming to rural, yes, compared to earlier, I did mention that the slowdown has bottomed out. It's on the path of recovery, all right signs in terms of macro level. And the only element which is unknown, and we'll know in thevnext few months' time, how that plays out is weather."
icicibank,"Over the last 2 quarters, in
each of the quarters, you've seen an over 30 basis points Q-o-Q increase in cost of
funds. So do we see this increase moderating from here on? ","I don't want to talk about the level, but we will see the cost of funds continue to
increase I would guess, for the next couple of quarters. And by then, the repricing
impact should have largely taken place, that trajectory will continue."
icicibank,"Any kind of colour that you could give on how much deposits have already
been repriced and how much are pending to be repriced, how much liability?","Not really, because it is a function of both scheduled and premature repayments and
also, of course, now given the growth in the deposit base itself, function of the rates
that we see incremental deposits are being raised. So, I think, you could try and look
at it based on sort of the current versus historic deposit rates and that should give a
fair idea. We still have some way to go."
icicibank,"So, in the quarter, at least on a
sequential basis, unsecured has grown much faster than secured, even housing. Is
there any challenge to asset quality in any of the segments?","we also pay
close attention to market commentary, as well as regulatory commentary and keep
looking at the portfolio and various cuts of the portfolio. So we are quite comfortable
with our origination and the quality of the portfolio that we have, as well as the
incremental volumes that we're doing. So, no concern from our side as such. I think,
we continue to see pretty decent opportunity for penetration in our existing customer
base, and also for new customer acquisition in our target segments."
icicibank,"So, firstly, on just the deposit
growth, a lot of catch-up which has happened in this particular quarter itself, getting
towards almost of 18-odd percent. So within this term deposits, incrementally how
much would have been, say, wholesale versus retail?","Since the proportion in our deposit base hasn't really changed. I think, we've always
said that 75% to 80% of our deposits overall are retail and that continues. So we've
seen pretty strong growth on the retail side. And of course, we have seen some flows
on the wholesale side as well, but retail continues to be the prime driver."
icicibank,"So,
Mahrukh also asked that question, but should we see further catch-up, maybe in the
deposits, which would have been raised currently, this would not have entirely got
reflected in terms of the cost of deposits now and that should lead to a higher cost
of deposits catch-up in the coming quarter?","As I mentioned, there is a deposit rate. Now, if you look at the retail deposit rate, it
has been more or less stable for the last 6, 7 months. So, to the extent that there are
deposits from prior periods that have to mature and reprice, that effect will play
through. In addition, of course, the growth in deposits itself. So, if you look at this
quarter, we have increased our term deposit base by about INR620 billion. So, that
growth in incremental deposit will also affect the overall cost. So we will see a
continuing increase in the cost of deposits for the next couple of quarters."
icicibank,"Sure. And second on employee costs. So, last time, you already had a one-off of the
retirement and maybe the pace was expected to moderate, but in fact, even on that
base we have seen a sequential uptake. So, you highlighted mainly the annual
incentives, but how much would be the stable level of employee cost we should look
at it? What was the one-off in terms of the annual incentives?","See, we don't really disclose the annual incentives, etc. But if you look at it, we had
done significant additions to the team in the second half of last year and we have,
of course, on top of that, added number of people in the first quarter as well. And
also, given the increments and started the year at that level. So that is what has led
to the increase in the employee cost. And from here on, we will see based on our business plans, we do expect to continue to hire, and that will start contributing to
revenues also at some point."
icicibank,"has there been any change in the way
ICICI Bank is looking at its subsidiaries now?","I don't think there is any fundamental change as far as ICICI Lombard is concerned.
As you are aware, our shareholding had come down below 50% due to an M&A that
the company has done."
icicibank,"there has been a slight increase in our NIM advances
this quarter, is it possible to share how much of this increase is due to the mix change
and growth and how much is due to repricing of loans?","So, this quarter, I think, if you look at it, we have seen some increase in our yield on
investments and on our yield on advances. I think, we did get some benefit of the
last repo hike, which happened during Q4, because the portfolio reprices over a
period of time based on the reset date. So that benefit did come. There was also
some benefit in the yield on investments, because of the repricing of some of the
floating rate bond portfolio and so on. So, assuming that repo rate remains where it
is, those kind of benefits will not be there in the subsequent quarters, that's correct."
icicibank,"One is, the attrition level at ICICI Bank, would it have gone up
in fiscal '23 versus fiscal '22?","So, first, I think on attrition we have not yet published our BRSR. That will come out
hopefully in the next 10 to 15 days, and then the numbers would be in the public
domain. I think you've seen the numbers which have come out of some of our peer
set, and they are reasonably high and that's reflective, I guess, of what is happening
across the system over the last 2 years, I would say. So I don't think that there is any
specific thing that we would want to call out really regarding attrition in our context."
icicibank,"Secondly, the growth that we're seeing in personal
loans and credit cards. So have you moderated down risk filters? Or is it due to more
cross-sells through your existing clients, like, if you could give some qualitative color
around that?","On your second question, on credit cards and personal loans, so we have not
moderated any sort of whatever diluted any risk filters on a large-scale basis. Of
course, we would always be trying to sharp shoot and sort of figure out which are the pockets where we can do more and which are the pockets that we should do
less. But broadly, I would say, our stance on risk has been quite consistent, and we
keep reviewing the portfolio and the outcome today are well within our tolerance
range."
indusindbk,how are you looking at the deposit repricing over the next few quarters?,"So, our cost of deposit, you should see the peaking out in quarter 2. And what has happened in quarter 1 is a lot of maturities, which are coming in, which were contracted at a lower price, got re-price in the retail side of the book as well as on the wholesale banking side of the book."
indusindbk,"And if I look at Slide 20, we have a 10-odd basis point increase in the wholesale banking yield and another 8 basis points in consumer banking, but our total yield has gone up by 22 basis points. So, what am I missing here?","That is because of the mix change is in favor of retail. Quarter 4, if you remember, there was strong microfinance disbursements. So, during the course of this quarter, averages were higher for retail compared to last quarter."
indusindbk,"Cost to income ratio has been increasing over the past few years. We have now close to 45%, 46% now. So how should we look at this as you go on to add more branches and invest in the business?","I've said that this year, we will end the year at 45% cost-to-income ratio. And that is what we said going to 41% to 43% in year two and stabilizing at about 40% to 41% in year three. While we may go up, at the end of the year you will see us stabilizing at 45% and we'll come back to 41% to 43% by year two. We have some initiatives and of course, the salary actions. So, this quarter has the salary appraisal part also. So that is all stabilized."
indusindbk,But did you see some downgrades because of that circular this quarter?,"No, we don't have any significant impact because of that. The numbers reflect all the circulars that are out there."
indusindbk,"Any thoughts on the promoter shareholding plans because this has been in the news for some time. And so where is the application really with RBI, what state it is?","The promoter has issued a press release, and we can only talk what is in the public domain that they want to increase the stake. The bank does not need the capital as of now. We also know that the process is still continuing, and there is no approval from RBI on the form A, as of now. So, we have to wait for the formal communication of the form A, which is the due diligence form from RBI, and that's a process which takes three months, almost two months are over. And I think, we have to wait for that announcement from the RBI or from the promoter."
indusindbk,"just wanted to understand from a deposit maturity and a renewal perspective, where are we in that journey?","I think, you would see that the yield curve between 90 days to year is almost flat. And it has come down, what happened in March was we had to raise some borrowings also as a consequence of the effect, which was happening in the US market in the liquidity market, we raised cost of borrowings at a little bit higher cost and that impact you were seeing happening."
indusindbk,"Risk weight assets have come down in the quarter with a decent balance sheet growth. So, if you can explain that and your credit risk weight to loans are probably lowest, I've seen for many years so?","So, a couple of key reasons for that. One is that some of the unrated portfolio got rated during the quarter, so that released some of the risk weights. And we also had some of the non-utilized limits getting reduced quarter-on-quarter, both for funded as well as non-funded, which caused release in the RWA."
indusindbk,"So, how confident we would be with respect to the credit cost trajectory of 1.1% to 1.3% odd percent?","So first of all, I'm comfortable with the 110 to 130 basis points, including the contingent reserve of INR400 crores to INR500 crores. We will add to the contingent resources. We've said that, and we will make sure that we do that."
indusindbk,"So, your credit cost guidance this year would factor in any additional provision for the security receipt contingent build-out and the net slippage, right?","So, we actually believe that all these costs are part of 110 basis points to 130 basis points."
indusindbk,Can you quantify the size of the non- MFI micro banking book once it increases?,"That's the merchant acquiring book that we disclosed in the loan mix. So, it's about INR4,222 crores."
infy,"On an annualized basis, you could have grown at 4% and your guidance is sub-par. So, I just wanted to
understand from you, are there deep client concerns that has, you know, made Infosys scale down the
guidance significantly?","So, the discussion on the guidance is sort of similar. We have seen many of these large and mega deal wins
really give us much more confidence in the way clients are working with us, especially on cost efficiency, even
with financial services, when we announce on transformation and also consolidation. However, there have
been delays in the start of some of these programs and the decision-making in those.
Coupled with that, we have also seen some of the volume during the quarter coming down because of clients
in the industries that I mentioned, so financial services, asset management, payments, mortgages, telco, etc.,
in those specific industries, reducing their volume of work. And those two things have combined for reducing
the guidance."
infy,"I had one more question on your deal win. You spoke about the $2 bn deal win. Would that qualify as Infosys'
biggest win that could potentially surpass Daimler?","So first, we are now sharing the deal value making sure that that is aligned to the regulations that are there.
For the past, we have actually never shared the deal value. So, it will be difficult to compare that."
infy,"The sector itself is going through a lot of people challenges, you
know, deferments of hikes and increments. So, if you can please clarify, what is the kind of hikes that you plan
to roll out this year?","Yes. So actually, on the compensations, we are actively under consideration as we speak. So, I am sure, you
will hear of it even before we finalize that, but it is under active consideration."
infy,"Short term, are you seeing more, the nature of the deals becoming more short term, ROI, cost takeout?","Yes, so we are definitely seeing consolidation, cost efficiency, automation, but we are not seeing short term,
meaning short projects like that. But those are the types of deals we are seeing which is more focused on the
efficiency as opposed to transformation."
infy,"So, Salil, you were talking about the fall in volumes across the portfolio. So, what
exactly is the reason for this fall in volume?","On the first one, the volumes, there mainly, it is clients in the industries that I was referencing, trying to maintain
their cost discipline to reduce what they consider discretionary in the short term"
infy,"I just wanted to ask about the $100 mn-plus clients, it is falling by 2 sequentially. So, is that because of the
ramp-down or is it because of projects getting completed?","So, we see many of these
sorts of actions, for example, in mortgages and financial services, or we see that in telecom, or we see that in
investment banking, or we see that in hitech. Those are the sorts of projects that typically have got less
attention in Q1."
infy,"So, have you priced in, like you said a lot of these start dates are baked in the second half of the year, 
So, the guidance now has baked in all the expected revenues, or do we see any improvement in guidance?","What we have announced as our wins on large deals and mega deals that is already in the guidance we have
given. As we go through the year, as there are more events in terms of wins, we will see what impact that has.
There could be impacts which are positive there could be impacts, depending on some of things, gets delayed
or not. But as of what we see today is what we have put into the guidance."
infy,what percentage of deals are AI led?,"On AI, first, we do not disclose the percentage of AI within our
portfolio. "
infy,"Do you see a
component of AI in majority of the deals?","However, AI or Generative AI is really transformative, and it is something that is changing everything
that is going on. For example, we are doing work, which is related to software development, which is related
to new code enhancements, migration, maintenance that covers the spectrum of the work that we do. And it is
also related to other areas, for example, voice, video, text. These are areas where we do work, which is
expanding the type of work we are doing. So, my sense is Generative AI is really going to transform everything
that is happening within our portfolio."
infy,"You said, there are some softeners in verticals like BFSI, hitech. So, will this
continue, or will it be better going forward in H2?","So there, on the first part, what we look at is, what we see within our portfolio on a daily, weekly, monthly basis.
It is, from our perspective, not something we look at as to when something will stop or not stop. We have within
our portfolio, work that we can do on digital transformation, cloud, Generative AI, which are really growth drivers
in the market. When clients or industries are looking at that we are ready with that, and we have that as one
of our growth engines."
jswsteel,"Could you give some NSR guidance like you gave for coking coal, similarly NSR, if you can?","It's difficult to give an NSR guidance because markets will not be in our hands. But I think it
would be fair to say that the cost benefit of the lower coking coal prices and some impact of
the recent iron ore price reductions would flow into our costs and therefore, reduce our costs in
this quarter. And that would essentially help the margins. So, the margins should be range-
bound. And on an absolute number, things will improve since the volume is expected to be
better."
jswsteel," So first is on coking coal. So, this quarter, we are looking at around
US$45-50 less coking coal cost?","Yes, we expect that Q2, the coking coal prices will be US$45 to 50 lower than Q1."
jswsteel,"Yes. You mentioned that some of those correction in the steel price will flow to Q2, so which
had happened in Q1, that will flow to Q2. So just how much would that be?","As we said, the US$45 to US$50. So, our Q1 coking coal was US$285, which increased by
US$11. We expect on this $285 a drop of US$45 to US$50 in Q2 in coking coal. Yes. So that
would positively impact our cost."
jswsteel,"Sure. And sir, this export, you mentioned it's around 15% of the volume. This momentum in
export will continue or because the global demand scenario is slightly volatile, how do you see
the export proportion moving, going ahead?","So, we would say that exports at this level, by and large, would continue. I would say, 15%
plus/minus a bit will be the exports, so maybe 12%, what we had, 12% to 13%, which we had
last year as a whole and has now been at 15% because last year was primarily impacted by the
export duty. As you are aware, JSW Steel has a wide range in terms of customers as well as
geographies to which we export almost 100 countries, 100 touch points, various product lines,
which we do. So we would like to continue to do our exports and maintain our presence. And
in the range of 15% exports is something which we expect will be there."
jswsteel,"Is it possible to share what is the acceptance number,
both revenue and capital?","Acceptances -- revenue acceptances, we have US$2.6 billion, and capex acceptances are
US$207 million."
jswsteel,"I mean, as the coking coal prices are normalizing and
correcting, should we expect this revenue acceptances to go down and consequently debt level
to increase just because of this lower acceptances going into the future?","Yes. Some part of the acceptances would go down because of the lower coking coal prices, but
it will also result into an improved EBITDA. So, net of that, we will have some reduction in
acceptances, which might have an initial impact on the debt."
jswsteel,"how much
would that be in terms of rupees crores?","We have communicated, India plus overseas spend of about INR20,000 crores spend for the
year. For the first quarter, we incurred about INR4,094 crores in India. We are on track to
spend the capex which we have committed at the beginning of the year."
jswsteel,"The first one is on the production side. We mentioned that in the
quarter gone by, we had 92% capacity utilization due to maintenance shutdowns. I understand
that there will be some destocking of inventory that will happen at our end. So, are we
planning to take any maintenance shutdown in Q2?","Yes. In Q1, we had 92% utilization because a lot of shutdowns were planned, but the target for
the year, i.e guidance is 26.34 million tonnes. We are very much on the target. For Q1, we
have achieved 100% production target."
jswsteel,"And what would be the capacity utilization
for India operations?","So, the shutdowns were planned. Usually, in the first quarter of the year, you have annual
maintenance shutdowns. And so that was something which is a part of the process. We don't
expect any undue shutdowns, which is other than planned to impact our annual production.
And therefore, we are quite confident that production numbers, which we have given in our
guidance will be achieved."
jswsteel,"Is it possible to let us know to
the cash flow from operations in the quarter?","Long-term surplus of INR264 crores from the cash flow. So what is the EBITDA, what we
have got is incremental INR264 crores."
jswsteel,"I think there was an imposition of about 25% duty on
aluminum and steel getting imported from India in 2018. And there seems to be some amount
of relaxation coming in from there?","So the safeguard of 25%, which was imposed is prevalent today as well. And there was a
discussion that certain lines and certain products they are looking at exempting, so we would
look forward to some direction and clarity on this once this is decided between both the
countries. That would certainly be a positive and open up further avenues for trade with U.S.
And certainly a positive to the market. Yes."
kotakbank,"My first question is on miscellaneous income. So it's been very strong this
quarter. You have trading gains of around 240 crore and then you have other and
miscellaneous of around INR 600 crore. So would you have any break up of that
income?","Mahrukh, that's something I mentioned earlier. We get dividend from the subsidiaries
largely in the first quarter. As I mentioned, that's about 300 plus crore in the bank
standalone. This quarter we also had some benefit of a transaction from our ARD team
which brought in another income into that category. So yes that is in addition to the
MTM gain which we talked about."
kotakbank,"So, personal loans as guided by
you are growing very well. They're growing at 7% to 8% Q-o-Q. Is that pace comfortable
given talks around some asset quality issues in some segments?","See as we see it right now we don't see any major issues in these segments. Having
said that, the overall credit environment is normalizing right now, but overall we are
comfortable with all the unsecured segments and the way they are currently behaving."
kotakbank,"So can you just highlight maybe what's
leading to that and what should be the sustainable level of slippages and the credit cost
with this unsecured pool?","Yes, so, you know, if you have to look at the entire credit environment and how it has
evolved over the last two or three years, and then look at the current context, you know,
the COVID period is one which really served to flush out a lot of the stress in the entire
system. That had two impacts overall.One, if you take out a lot of the bad assets over a period of time, therefore, in the
following periods, a lot of the overall credit costs come down because the flows also
come down because recoveries tend to be good in that period and, you know, super
normal.
The second is because a lot of the weaker accounts have got flushed out, what you also
find is that subsequent underwriting in the immediately subsequent period tends to be
much better."
kotakbank,"anything on ECLGS, maybe the flow from the SME was that relatively higher in the
overall slippages or maybe broader slippages across the segments are being similar to
what we have seen in last few quarters?","No, flows from SME were not higher than normal and they're absolutely normal right
now."
kotakbank,"So because of the success of the ActivMoney product, I'm just wondering if you would
still maintain the stance you had in the previous quarter call, where you said that NIM
probably, based on your assessment so far, does not decline below 5%. Would that still
be correct, given that ActivMoney seems to be cannibalizing CASA?","So just let me take that. Yes, if you look at the fact that this quarter, last quarter itself,
we had talked about the fact that the 5.75% was a peak and you could see some
correction there. We've talked about this period we've closed at 5.57%. While the
ActivMoney does mean that we are paying higher than what we would have done on savings account, but recognize that the ActivMoney costs us decently lower than what
a equivalent time deposit would have cost."
kotakbank,"I think that the cash and other balance increased quite a bit at the quarter end. Is there
some one-off here or maybe?","Some of that is 2000 rupee notes which came in there but not a significant one. It's
actually if you look at the last year it was 40,000, we are at 44,000 right now. So it's not
completely unusual there"
kotakbank,"Now, if I try and impute from that, the
cost of term deposits, it seems to indicate that, from the bottom of first quarter last
year, it seems to be up about 200 basis points. So is that rough number correct? And
does that mean that, there is not much incremental re-pricing that is to happen on the
term deposit book?","No, I don't think it's as sharp as 200 basis points. If you look at last year to this year, it
would be certainly lower than the 200 basis points, which you're talking about. We need
to look at it on an average basis, not on a period end basis."
kotakbank,"So any indication on where we are
in terms of the incremental versus the stock of term deposits, perhaps?","Yes. So lot of the term deposits, which are taken earlier, durations are not long. So a lot
of them have got priced in, in terms of the renewals. And as we go forward, some more
will get priced in, but assuming the rates stay as they are, then maybe after a quarter or
so, I guess most of that would have happened."
kotakbank,"So your attrition rate has gone up quite sharply over the last two years.
What's causing this and how it's impacting your operations?","So if you see the breakup of the attrition, and I
just want to quote some numbers, at the senior management level, it's around 10%, at
the middle management level, it's less than 20%. It's only in the junior management,
which is really at about 50%, which is what our disclosure is. And this is largely in sales,
service and call center, some amount in collections Firstly, this was the first full year post COVID, where people have decided their calls as
far as their careers are concerned and we have had some spillover of attrition this year. We are focusing on a number of areas to reduce the attrition. Working on a number of platforms and areas, including how to make ease of working,
better engagement, training, benchmarking, and technology automation and how to
make their lives easier."
kotakbank," Is it the reason that cost, employee cost is going up for all
the banks? ","So I think, if you look at it, from an employee cost perspective, Jaimin gave you the
number, if you take out the retiral one time cost, it is 20% Y-o-Y and if you see banks
across, that is a number that is more than in line with industry trends. More importantly,
it is important from a longer term productivity perspective to reduce the attrition. So,
that is where I would put the emphasis on."
lt,"Does the current quarter include High-Speed Rail order,
which we announced on 22nd of July?","So the orders in the Infrastructure segment includes the C3 order. As you may be aware, this
bid happened on 11th of April, early April 2023 and as part of the process, the letter of award
was formally issued in July, but before June itself, we had completed the relevant
documentation. And incidentally, since we are executing the C4 package, I also would say that
the preliminary work for the C3 package also has started."
lt,"The core margin Y-o-Y were weak.
So when do you think the impact of the legacy projects will wear off?","So a major part of these jobs should get completed in the first half or possibly definitely by Q3
of the current year. And it is basis this construct that we have given a guidance of 9% for the
full year with a clear view that the first 6 months for Infra could be a little subdued."
lt,"My first question is on the mention of the commercial property sale during the quarter, which
you mentioned in your press release, could you just elaborate a bit on that, sir?","As you are aware, our Realty business comprises of both commercial and residential real
estate. In Q1, we completed the sale of a commercial real estate in Bombay that gave us almost
around Rs 80 crore of profit and it is included in the segment result of the Others segment."
lt,"So could you elaborate on how much support we have
received so far?","Okay. So in FY '23, we received the government assistance of Rs 100 crores. In Q1 current
year, we received another Rs 150 crores. And as we speak in the month of July, we have
received another Rs 300 crores. So in all aggregate, we have received Rs 550 crore till date,
and we expect to possibly get another Rs 450 crores, which is the first instalment of Rs 1,000
crores very shortly."
lt,"And what is the view on the outlook of getting maybe Rs 2,000 crores over the
period of 3 years. And are we on track on the revenue?","So I would say it has been building our overall construct that Rs 1,000
crores each of the years in FY '24 and FY'25 and FY '23 is what got spilled over, but we do
expect the government to help us out disbursing the money’s at the soonest."
lt,Can you elaborate a bit more on what's driving this execution strength?,"So Puneet, it's a combination of all the statements that you made i.e. the size of the order book and the scale of the projects that we have secured over the last two years in terms of larger project outlays, larger project bids"
lt,"Is it just the sheer number of projects that you're doing has gone up or the
scale has gone up -- what's driving this humongous growth in revenue?","So, the size of the projects and the scale of the project has
helped us to achieve this kind of revenue execution momentum and that is what is helping us
out. And as you may be aware, we are also investing a lot on construction equipment or project
equipment that will enable us to speed up the execution momentum."
lt,"first question is on the statement said that the prospect
pipeline has increased and large part of these are large size orders from railways and other
segments. So what we are seeing is that on the capital goods orders, somewhere we are hitting
the capacity constraint. So we see the coming quarters, there could be some challenges on the execution side because of shortage of equipment. And you can highlight in which segments
you have seen this kind of buildup happening where the capacity utilisation has been gone up
from the supply side?","So Parikshit, while I was giving you the order prospects pipeline where I also gave a split of
the 5.85 prospect pipeline for Infrastructure segment for the balance 9 months. I also gave you
a breakup ranging between Transportation Infrastructure, which is the highest to Minerals and
Metals at 6%, which is the lowest across the entire 5 or 6 subsegments that we have. Once
again, I wish to reiterate here that the actual set of opportunities that could come in these
segments could be possibly even more higher, but we are mindful of the fact that today, the
Infrastructure segment itself is having almost a 3 trillion order book for execution. So we are
targeting the projects where we have the capacity to execute and also the competition intensity
for such kind of a orders is a shade lower."
lt,"So, can you highlight on what stage we are in
terms of closures and most likely when we get approval, there's money coming in?","So, at this juncture, as you may be aware, IDPL is a holding company that has 8 operating road
assets and one transmission line asset. The approvals from agencies like NHAI, Ministry of
Road and Surface Transport and other customers is in the progress. The target is to try to
complete it in Q2, but there is a possibility it can slip over to Q3."
lt,"Could you give some color on what is driving this increase, whether it is onshore,
offshore hydrocarbons, overseas or domestic and so on?","I think I gave you the breakup of Hydrocarbons, both over domestic and overseas. So, the total
Hydrocarbon prospects is at Rs 3.47 trillion, okay. I think you can take Rs 1 trillion as offshore
and Rs 2.5 trillion as onshore."
ltim,if you could help us with the quantum of the wage hikes for the year?,That will be in line with the industry standard. So it will be pretty much as per the plan that we had laid down at the beginning of the year.
ltim,"Now we have seen this marginal drop this quarter, say minus 1%, and you guys have also ramped up a little bit on deals. And in your opening remarks, you spoke about some benefit or some clients at least opening up the execution part, while some continue to be in pause. Now as we enter 2Q, 3Q and some of the clients are also looking at almost half the year gone by with, let's say, 4 months in pause. So what are your expectations here?","Yes. So I'll take that. So if you look at BFSI grew 12% Y-o-Y for us. And I think Mohit you actually raised an important point. What we are seeing is, for most of our clients, they work on a calendar year basis, right? So for 6 months, this calendar year, their own spend has been muted. So we are seeing some signs where they're looking to see for the rest of the year, what are the programs that they continue to fund. But I think as of now, I mean I hate using the word budget flush, but there is nothing in that direction, just to give you a sense. So people are looking to do programs, where the ROI , where there is clear benefit that the business is getting or where there is a need from a risk and compliance perspective, those are the programs that are getting funded. But what we are seeing is that what DC talked about, the continuing hiring freezes still continue. I think it's about the next couple of months where we'll figure out whether they will continue to stay for the rest of the year or they will start to ease off in this quarter, rest of their calendar year."
ltim,"And second one was this reclassification of 1,000-odd employees. Does their job profile change? Or do they continue to do the same work.","The job profile doesn't change. As we were bringing both the companies together, each of us had sort of slightly different way of categorizing certain functions. So as part of our merger synergies, we looked at industry standard practices and adopted those. So what they were doing or what the functions they are part of remains the same. It's just that those functions are now reported consistently to the rest of our peer group in how they are classified."
ltim, It looks like there is a very sharp growth recovery in the top account. Is this possibly related to any budget flush in that account given their fiscal closes in June?,"I can only say that if you look at the top 5, there is a decent growth in terms of the top 5 accounts. And as a part of our top 100 program, we are going to stay very focused in terms of the Focus 100 accounts and which will also reflect in the growth of the top 20 as well as top 40 accounts. So that's what we should be looking at."
ltim,"Also any color from the top account on how the budgets were, how their new fiscal year is shaping up, given it sets the tone for a lot of tech activity?","But to your specific questions, in terms of High-tech, I would say, first of all, some of the fiscal years are July to June. But overall, in terms of High-Tech, we can see very good momentum, including all the accounts that is part of that portfolio."
ltim,"Any budget cuts that you are seeing in your broader portfolio of key clients, let's say, the top 100 clients?","Actually, what's interesting is in the recent Gartner article, they have talked about a 5% growth in budgets even in this year. I think the thing is the budget on paper exists, but the decisions are going to the board, and they are taking more cautious decisions in quarter as they wait to see what -- see, it is a paradoxical time, right? Where governments are looking to see what they can do about inflation. So central banks, whereas unemployment is lower, you know whereas other indicators suggest that demand is healthy. So I think clients are also trying to figure out this paradox and taking decisions accordingly. I think we see a stability in interest rate regime, which we are likely to see, then I think clients will have a lot more confidence in terms of releasing the budgets that they've already actually planned for during the financial year at least as per projections that the likes of Gartner have made."
ltim,So do you expect the remaining quarters growth to be paced out equally across the quarters?,"Well, I think as you can make out, as we have indicated that some of the concerns that we have are more in terms of the freezes in terms of onboarding that we see in some of the BFS clients as well as the delay in decision-making. Now that's something which we will hope that by Q1, it should be easing out which did not. And I don't think we can predict in terms of where it will be , but otherwise, there is nothing for us to believe that our second half will be any different from the second half of last year, for example. So I think the only thing we are hoping is some of the freezes go away and some of this decision- making is faster. And I think that actually help us in terms of looking into the rest of the year."
ltim,"So as you mentioned in your opening remarks, that continues to see strong demand. So I mean, is the demand again in the travel vertical across the board?","Well, I would say travel and hospitality is seeing good traction and the business travel is not back to the same levels, but otherwise, we can see very good traction in terms of travel as well as in the rest of the hospitality, the hotels, etc., hotels as well as the restaurant chains, etc, all these things are definitely showing good traction."
ltim,"One is on the employee costs. So headcount is down about 2% quarter-on-quarter. But despite that, employee costs are flat to slightly up. This is even with an effort to shift slightly offshore by about 10 basis points. So I want to check if there are any one- off costs in employee costs this quarter, such as bonus for people or some sort of wage adjustment as part of the integration.","No, Ravi, there is no one-off cost involved into it. This is partly driven by some of the policy harmonization that we do as part of these 2 companies coming together. And also, there is a slight increase in the on-site, while the net headcount has come down, there's an increase in the on-site headcount versus the offshore headcount, this is the new incremental headcount that comes in. So that has resulted into the cost being a little bit higher. But no alarming thing, nothing to worry about that."
ltim,"We usually have a seasonality with the pass through going away, but this seems a bit more than usual. So is there anything that's vertically specific, client specific in ROW?","Yes. ROW is client specific. See for us, the 2 biggest markets, which contribute 90% of our revenue are Europe and the U.S. and both are U.S. is up 10% Y-o- Y and Europe is up 7.3% Y-o-Y. So this is client specific. The business in this region tends to be much more project specific. So as projects get over, those kind of changes. We have also been careful about some of the programs that we're entering, especially in the India market, being cautious to make sure that we choose the right projects to bid."
m&m,"is the company planning to apply to the regulators for a board
seat on RBL board?","So, the answer is no. Our approach was at this point just to take a stake that was meaningful
enough for us to be able to engage with them, but we do not have an intention as I said of
becoming a bank. So, there is no discussion of a board seat. There is no intention from our side
to take a board seat. And that's where we are."
m&m,"Manoj, can I ask one question just on the financials, if you could just talk us through in terms
of what were the price increases and commodity changes that we have seen for the quarter and
how is the outlook for second quarter and the price increases there?","So, I think I won't give specific price increases etc., but I think more from a perspective of
looking forward, I think two parts here. So, we do expect that the commodity environment at
least what we are pricing in is a benign environment going forward also and I think in that
environment, I think we'll have to see what we can do on the pricing front. I think that's point
#1. Point #2 is as we look at from a goal perspective as we have, if you saw the quarter-on-
quarter margin increases, I think we are all goaled towards improving margins over a period of
time and that's something we will strive towards. So, I think that's the broad guidelines without
getting into the details of how much price increase etc., I think, and this is a dynamic kind of
phase where we will take select price increases in select products at different times. But
Rajesh, any more color if you want to add?"
m&m,"This is coming
from Raghunandhan, who's basically asking whether with commodity prices in a benign
environment and also run out of introductory pricing, do you see those helping you on
margins?","Yeah, the answer is not going to be very different to both of these questions. I think we made
substantial progress and over delivered on what we had said will be the margin improvements.
We had said that we will not get anywhere near F19 margins unless we see a significant
commodity correction. We are very close to F19 margins in spite of not having a significant
commodity correction or a significant correction in cost structures. So, I think you should just
trust our desire as much as yours to want to over deliver on margin because that's important for
us as well. So, I would just leave it at that rather than saying are we going to increase margin
by X or Y or Z? That I think the trend line show our intent."
m&m,"My question is can you double click on the review mechanism which we have set in place for
monitoring whatever targets for each of your subsidiaries which you have said, what is the real
review mechanism and I think you also talked about implementation is the core, right. What is
that?","So, there are two sets of things we have. First is we've got a set of what we call war rooms, but
they're essentially strategy review once a year. Three months later, budget review, which is a
budget set based on that strategy. Three months later, a people review, which is do we have the
right set of people to be able to drive that and three months later an operating review, which is
how is the business operating as compared to the budget that we've set? So, that's an annual
cycle of reviews that we do for every business, which is a very in-depth discussion. In the case
of auto and farm, it will span an entire day, in the case of some of the other businesses, it may
not spend an entire day, it would be half a day or it may be a little less based on the size of the
business. The second thing that we have is a monthly review for what we call breakthrough
projects. So, for each of these businesses, especially where we have investment, we are looking
at what is the clear set of outcomes that will be driven. What are the input metrics for that
investment? And therefore, there's a monthly review on breakthrough projects with each of
those businesses and that's how we continue to look at, are we on track? If we are not on track,
what corrective action should we take and I mean, everything will not work. If everything is
working, then we're not taking enough risk. There may be some things that don't work, but we
need to be able to take corrective action quickly and that maybe is one thing I've missed in
Kapil’s question on capital allocation is the ability to act fast if things don't work, we're not
going to stay sort of long and keep waiting for or hoping for things to turn around over a long
period of time. And that's part of the reason for this review philosophy."
m&m,"These are all farm related. So, let me start with the first one, Farm machinery. What does
it take to get to 40%?","Actually, we won't worry about how to get to 40%. I think that we are sure is going to happen
during the course of the year. We are on a low base relative to the size of the Indian market.
Size of the Indian market is in the region of 6000 crores-7000 crores. We are right now in the
region of 600 crores-700 crores. So, we are way below the weight we need to play. So, we
would be very disappointed if we don't do 40% this year. We actually have to look at much
higher growth rates, multiple new products and segments that we're getting into. We are
relaunching the Swaraj harvestor with a significantly improved product in the next season,
which is a month from now. So, there are multiple initiatives in play and we'll be very
disappointed if we don't do 40%."
m&m,"Second question is why are exports muted? On the farm side, tractor specifically.","So, basically two key reasons. One is the US is a key part of exports. The US industry for
tractors in the segments in which we play is going through a significant industry degrowth
after a significant industry growth through the first two years of COVID. So, obviously we are
adjusting for that in the way that we export tractors to North America. We don't want to just
get into exporting mindlessly and building inventory there. So, keeping in norm the right
inventory levels that we need either in our network or with us in the company, Magna, we are
adjusting exports to that. So, the US is one part of that. South Asia has been under stress for
multiple reasons. Sri Lanka, we all know, has been having a crisis which is affecting the auto
exports as well. So, that's the other piece. So, these are the two primary pieces, markets like
Turkey, etc. were actually doing extremely well, Brazil we are doing extremely well. All of
these are now growing very well and also extremely profitable."
m&m,"And the last question is from Jinesh from Motilal Oswal who's asking based on the first quarter
performance, do you expect improved outlook for the rest of the year for the farm business?","For the industry, I think the question will be related to industry."
m&m,"One is one of the important aspects of
capital allocation is also giving back cash to shareholders, surplus cash to shareholders. What
are your thoughts on dividends or potential buybacks, etc?","So, first we've increased dividends significantly this year. I think about 40% or somewhere in
the 35% to 40% range. And our approach is that if we cannot use capital effectively to be able
to generate returns over and above what other industry participants would generate, we give it
back to our investors. So, we will look at how we give it back in the best form if we have to.
Right now, we're waiting for our EV plans to get completely finalized to make sure we've got
enough buffers for that and if we have to then start giving back we will do it at that point in
time. We are in a significant growth mode at this point, which is why we haven't done more
than that so far. But despite that, I'd say close to a 40% increase in dividend is a pretty good
start in that front."
m&m,"A couple of questions
on the SUV side. One is Rajesh, you mentioned the cancellation. rate on bookings is about 8%.
Is that a monthly number or a quarterly number or how should we look at it and 3rd on the
SUV side again, how have retails clocked in,1Q wholesale were about 101. How were retails?","So, 8% is an approximate number. Basically, what it's an average of the quarter, but there's not
much difference through the quarter. So, it's typically cancellation on the base of open
bookings."
m&m,Is it a monthly cancellation or a quarterly cancellation?,"So, if you look at quarter one, the while the figure is about an average of 8%, we calculated
every month. It ranges in the range of about 4% to 8%. That's the rate of cancellation every
month, we track it month-on-month. On your question on retail, I think one factor that I just
want to put in perspective is, don't forget that it's only now that we've been able to scale up the
billing to a certain level as compared to where we were earlier. Dealer stocks were really low,
even just in terms of perspective, we are about 10% lower on retail compared to the billing for
the period. The dealer stocks are still at about 30 days, so the stocks, it's not that we've
overstocked the dealer and we will now get into the festive season cycle, which is again when
we will destock."
maruti,"Can we talk about have we thought what could be the timelines and mode of consideration, so will it be in the form of cash only or there can be other options like share swap, etc., also which may be evaluated.","This part has not been deliberated so far. As we mentioned both in the press release and in the CFO speech in the beginning, this will be deliberated in a subsequent board meeting and we wish to complete it within this financial year by March 2024."
maruti,"And also, the outlook and inventory level, if you could talk about that demand outlook and inventory level?","The demand outlook is fine at the moment. If you notice in Q1, competition (industry minus Maruti) grew by about 7%, while Maruti could grow over 12%. Since we have a good model lineup of recently launched, mostly SUVs, we expect that momentum to continue. The only issue is that in Q2, the last year base is very high. So, while the absolute sales should continue, the growth figures might look less in Q2 because of a high base last year."
maruti,"Will there be any efficiency gains here as well, which will be there for the combined entity that you can envision?","Broadly speaking, yes. We have so many powertrains, ICE engine base, the EV base, and the hybrid. There would have been some challenges if we had not integrated them together, at least now the decisions would be far more agile. We can quickly make changes in the production plan, location plan etc. MD also mentioned in the press conference, we are also expecting some economies of scale."
maruti,"Is it fair to assume that the recurring run rate may be a bit lower than where we are today, or you think these are going to be the sustainable level on special marketing costs?","So, one I mentioned is that there is some 80-basis point expenditure on account of employee cost which is not recurring in nature because we had to account for these in the first quarter as we had paid some retention bonuses etc. to employees for a long term retention. But the other expenses, it will depend on the period in which the launches takes place or the events take place. It may vary a little bit, as we launch more models. Marketing expenses will continue to be at this pace in the near future. So, this is an investment we are making in the long run, not for a shorter period. They will remain to be a little stepped up."
maruti,"So, before I fall back in the queue, just a clarification, does it include even the EV facility, the EV assembly plant and also what will be the status of the battery plant sir because I guess there will be some involvement of Toyota as well there. So, if you can just help us understand those aspects on the EV side?","So, the EV manufacturing facility is part of SMG and since SMG will be part of MSIL, if everything goes through, so EV will also come to MSIL. The battery is the global project of Suzuki. It has been located in India because the volumes in India for Suzuki are the maximum. So, that will be part of a 100% subsidiary of SMC called SRDI (Suzuki R&D Center India Private Limited)."
maruti,"As per the data available on MCA, the net worth or the book value was about Rs.12,700 crores for last 3 years. So, broadly that would be the latest book value for FY23?","Yes, that is the book value as of March 2023. We will have to wait till the whole process of approval is over and then compute the book value at that point in time. So, it should not significantly change from what you see in March 23."
maruti,"And relating to that, if you can talk a bit about volume potential for Fronx, can it do 12,000 to 15,000 per month including exports and what would be the order book for Fronx? Thank you.","Fronx, currently we are doing approximately 9,000/ month and exports have just started, so exports volume will add to it and order book on Fronx, we have about 22,000-23,000 pending bookings on Fronx. "
maruti,Would there be a material impact on account of vendor imports given JPY movement in fourth quarter?,"Not significant enough, I think there is small impact, but not significant."
maruti,"And sir lastly, what was the royalty rate for the quarter?",3.80%
maruti,"Between now and when the EV launches in 2025, could you talk about if there are more sort of SUV products in the pipeline or are we looking to consolidate the recently launched 3 products?","I thought you'll be very happy about the recent launches, look at the volumes of these. As a policy, we don’t comment about the future product plans. But you're right for some time we have to look at maximizing the volumes from these current launches."

powergrid,"Yes, just wanted to understand from the fact that you talked about CapEx increasing from ₹8,800 crore. So, for '24, what could that number be?","Yes, so in FY 23-24, we expect it to cross ₹10,000 crores CapEx this year and in FY 24-25. We have given you the ₹1,88,000 crore number for the next 10 years, that factors these projects which are coming up through the NCT and the government approvals."
powergrid,"But just trying to understand in terms of while this is eight, nine-year stuff that you talked about, in the interim, say 25-26, will there be an increased CapEx and then it will come down because the government's plans are in terms of 500 gigawatts, so, transmission lines should start getting auctioned and being built before that, right?","Yes, Right. So, it will not be like in 25-26. All transmission will be built before the target of 2030. So, it will come maybe little ahead of the generation, but it will not be like three years ahead or four years ahead. So, the CapEx will go up, I don't see the CapEx coming down before 2030. It will only be an increasing trend."
powergrid,any status on Leh HVDC?,That is still under government approval for the subsidy component.
powergrid,"And these two projects that we have won, what is the project cost in broad numbers?",We have given the tariff that’s about ₹340 crores.
powergrid,"Thank you for the opportunity. Sir, I have three questions. First is, during the IPO of the InvIT, in your media interactions, you had highlighted that there will be 18 additional projects of ₹22,500 crores which will be sold to the InvIT. We haven't seen any movement on that. So, what is the status now and why the delay?","We said that’s the pipeline which would be available, but post the National Monetization Pipeline, there has been a change in the stand. Now the guidelines require us not to transfer ownership, but only rights to the cash flows. So, we are adopting the Securitization route rather than Monetization through transfer to InvIT. So that is why assets are not going to the InvIT at present."
powergrid,"Okay, so will it be the case that POWERGRID kind of aims for the TBCB assets. And will the InvIT have to learn and find the assets individually itself?","I won't talk for the InvIT, but I am talking as far as POWERGRID is concerned. We are looking to raise funds at the optimal cost, and in terms of the government framework, asset transfer, ownership transfer is not permitted. So, if we do cash flow transfer through the InvIT route, it's not working out. There are tax implications and value decretive to the shareholders. So, we have observed that the Securitization route of raising debt on the strength of the TBCB cash flows is compliant with the NMP framework and is also optimal fund raising for POWERGRID."
powergrid,if you could talk about the competitive landscape in the recent bids of TBCB?,"Yes, so we are observing that for smaller ticket size projects say less than ₹1000 crores, there are seven-eight bids received. For Larger ticket projects say ₹2000 crores plus, four or five bids are received.
Competition remains very intensive. There is no let down in that."
powergrid,"What is your expectation of equity
IRRs?","Mid-teens will not be there even in a regulated environment. So, I think early double-digits can be a fair assumption."
powergrid,"Last question is we are seeing very tight supply chain on equipment supply, especially globally and we have seen increase in the prices also because U.S., Europe is going very strong on the HVDC and transmission, how is that impacting the supply chain and
the pricing for us?","You are very right about supply chain constraints in the HVDC space. Due to the renewable energy integration in the West, there has been a significant spike in the demand for HVDC and cables. The timelines, what has been asked in the NCT approvals, we are finding
will also be a challenge.
So, we are taking up with the government that these timelines are not possible to adhere to, given the supply chain constraints. As far as pricing is concerned, since these are TBCB projects where we would like to have some understanding with the equipment manufacturers, and we would like to build that into our pricing.
And challenges will be there because of the large size of the project and the variables which are there in terms of exchange rate variation, in terms of price escalation. So, these are indeed challenges which need to be factored in when we make our quote."
powergrid,"The draft regulation will be there sometime in November, December and final in February, March. What are your
expectations for the regulated assets?","The approach paper of the staff is out. I think yesterday we have submitted our comments on it. From the discussion paper, though there have been several alternatives proposed, there is a fair degree of emphasis on regulatory certainty and there is also a suggestion to grandfather the provisions for existing assets and any changes can be taken up for the new assets. I think this is a good approach which is given in that paper. And what we would like to have is continuation, because as far as transmission tariffs are concerned, much of it is on normative basis, so there is not much to change. May be, making it more easy to do other businesses will help."

sbilife,"If you can help contribution of other banks in AP terms, I mean, what
their percentage currently?",3%. Approximately 3%.
sbilife,"So the question was, sir, the expenses management guidelines have been
revised. So there is chatter around what payouts can you do to SBI, can one
expect renegotiations and commissions or cost ratios to go up?","So see, the whole business of insurance, it depends on what value you
create for the customers and what value create for the distributors.
Obviously, it's going to be a balance there. With the changed regulations, we
will be reevaluating. And IRDA requires us to have a policy around that. So,
our policy is under formulation. The moment we have a clear policy on that,
we will take it forward."
sbilife,"So just wanted to understand if
these increased payouts will affect our VoNB margins. I think with lower
VoNB margins you could indicate, even if the payouts are higher","This is a very fluid kind of situation, not just because of these EOM guidelines
or something, earlier, also we were very comfortably placed in terms of the
percentage of expenses that we had, considering our EOM limits and also we
never went up to the EOM limit in the past also. And we are not looking to these guidelines as an excuse to change the way
we look at business. So, our business will continue to be fair to our partners
and our customers. So, I will not put any numbers out here. And I will definitely not like to commit to any kind of a drastic change in my way of
doing things.
But what we will ensure, which we have been doing in the past, and that is
why we have been so successful as a company is that we will make sure that
there is enough on the table for the distributor and the customer."
sbilife,"Sir, as I see the product, the margin compression largely happened, it seems
to have happened because of your non-par contribution coming down. And
that's the only product which has declined on a year-on-year basis while all
other products seems to have done well. So just wanted to understand this is
a conscious decision to not to grow?","What I would like to say is that you have
noticed very correctly that it is a non-par component, which has actually led
to a reduction in VNB margin. So that is absolutely correct. But now to read
too much into that would be, I think, slightly jumping the gun because like I
said, last year, the same quarter, we had a huge growth in our premiums.
And one of the contributing factors was that we had this huge pent-up
demand for non-par guaranteed income product, which we did not have earlier. We had a non-par guaranteed lump sum payment product, which was
doing very well, Smart Platina Assure. But we launched Smart Platina Plus
last year around March and March and to be precise, about seven, eight days
in March and then the first quarter.
So the huge pent-up demand that we had and the agents and our distributors
had already gauged due to which we had launched that product. That got
taken up in the first quarter, and that is why you are seeing a de-growth in
this quarter with respect to the non-par product.
But going forward, we are looking at a very steady growth in our non-par
portfolio. And there is no conscious effort to reduce or change the mix. You
will probably recollect that every quarter, I keep saying that we keep the
customer at the center, and it is not a joke. We do keep the customer at the
center. We offer products which are suitable. This quarter, we have seen a
good traction for ULIP product returning. ULIP has always been a good
product for us. ULIP has returned. One reason could be the market's
excellent performance and our own funds excellent performance over the last
five years. And this is something which people are looking at.
Last year, with the COVID uncertainties, non-par guaranteed was very
favoured kind of product. And I don't see the demand going away anywhere.
It is only that compared to last year first quarter, which again, I'll emphasize
was one of the highest growth quarters that we had. That is the only reason
why we are seeing a slight dip in that."
sbilife,"So firstly, on retail protection. So, while we did really
well in FY '22 when most of the other peers were struggling to grow
protection, over the past four to five quarters, if you really look at it, the
growth hasn't been that robust given the kind of under penetration we see in
retail protection. And we are also seeing some of our peers who were lagging
earlier have started to pick-up in terms of growth on weaker base of course.
So just wanted to understand, I mean, what is it that we can do to accelerate
it or the things there any particular reasons why this thing is slightly tepid than
where it could be?","Look, we have been continuously growing protection. So there is not a single
quarter, I believe, when we have actually had our protection dip or have a
negative growth. So we have been constantly growing. Right now, we have
grown at 6%. And going forward, like we see the same trajectory like the
previous years.
Whatever we have grown in the previous years in protection, we will grow.
Protection has got a good potential, I should say. But what does happen is that when you have very good growth in all the products, then it is quite
possible that in percentage terms, there may be slightly lower growth seen
here in protection because everything is growing, so everything grows at 20%
or something. So protection, even if it grows slightly less in terms of actual
numbers, appears to have de-grown in percentage terms. So that is the only
thing that I would say. I don't think there is any particular thing to be read into
the protection growth numbers."
sbilife,"Sir, so just to clarify, have we reached up equilibrium on -- at a product level
margin?","Possible, but I don't see the mix change and all. See what happens like last
year, we had a mix change and we had a jump in the margins. But this is not
something which we can expect again-and-again because there is a certain
kind of a demand that is available in the market. Maybe if tomorrow, we come
and see that there is another product or something which contributes a better
margin, which has got a great demand. Maybe there is another spike coming
up at that point of time. I can't see anything right now. We would have been
very happy to be around this range."
sbilife,"You reported a fairly impressive 17% growth in unit linked policies. So, I was
wondering what is driving this?","No, I don't think we have ever pushed or stopped pushing for ULIP. It is a
function of the overall market, the way people are perceiving like you would
see in the last couple of years, a lot of non-par guaranteed got sold. So, it
was purely a function of the experience of the last three years where you were uncertain about your income and all and the first thing that you wanted
to protect was future income."
sbilife,"The second question is essentially on group protection that has grown
pretty fast. So this is all group credit?","Yes, group protection, it's a lumpy kind of thing. I mean, you get -- you work
on various corporates for some time and then you get the business. So it's a
big function of two, three things. One is connect, your ability to service. You
have to prove that your product is well serviced quickly, your employees
when they come for a claim or something, they will be serviced very fast and
will not have to go through trouble and all that. So, that once the corporate is
convinced, then the business comes up in a big amount.
Sometimes it's 1,000 people who are covered, sometimes it's 10,000 who are
covered, I mean, like it's a very lumpy kind of thing. You can't say -- the effort
for each corporate would be approximately the same kind of effort, but the
numbers that you get will be different from for different corporates."
sbilife,How much would be the growth in group protection?,"Group protection sir we have credit life. So, credit life that is something which
has been growing very well for us and I think it will continue to grow very well
because disbursements are going to keep growing as the market grows as
everything, as everything economy grows, the disbursements will grow. And
as the disbursement grow the attachment rates will be better. And even with
the same attachment rate, the amount of credit life we sell will be higher."
sbilife,"Have you built in any increase in EOM in your margin
reporting of this quarter?","Thanks, Madhukar. See, if you see our EV disclosure on 31st March, each
year we'll do that. You see that we make the operating profit even on account
of the persistency and we always keep saying that when we set our best
estimate assumption, we always use the assumption which is sustainable in
longer term. We don't capitalize the movement up and down. To that extent,
our VoNB margin and assumption used in computing VoNB margin is well
stabilized. And with the certain fall in the persistency it is not going to impact
our persistency assumptions.
In fact, if you recall, in the March, we have explained that there is a further
scope to further improve the persistency on account of the experience. So, to
conclude, I don't see this experience will have any adverse impact on our
VNB margins."
sbin,"So, going forward with this kind of 14 - 15% guidance, are we fully like having the sanctions and the proposals in the pipeline that in next three quarters we run four and half to five percent every quarter, the loan book, this is my first question, sir.","Okay, fine. Okay. Well, what you mentioned in terms of you should compare the credit growth on a sequential as compared to a year on year. You know, when it comes to the economy, why there's a busy season and the lean season? There are certain reasons because our economy has got certain characteristics. So, likewise, I still stick to my argument, that first quarter, we should compare only on a quarter-on-quarter basis, not on a quarter-on-quarter but on a year-on-year basis. Because the kind of situation we witness in the first quarter of any financial year are very different as compared to the last quarter.
- Now, your second question, when you are comparing the growth in advances on a quarter-on-quarter basis, certainly my submission to you would be that there are reasons why we are not doing it. And it is borne out of what we have seen over the years."
sbin,"Sir, when you referred here of the competition now with this grand merger of HDFC and HDFC Bank, which has become a behemoth now, and I think the credit book is also almost of our size or maybe I have not just compared?","Sir, when you referred here of the competition now with this grand merger of HDFC and HDFC Bank, which has become a behemoth now, and I think the credit book is also almost of our size or maybe I have not just compared."
sbin,"Not updated. Okay. So now that big bank is again a private sector that is coming in. From the competition point of view is there any particular working, any action plan to take on them with this changed scenario?","They are focusing on the physical branch expansion, and we are focusing on digital as well as physical as well as other channels. And as I mentioned that we are very mindful about in terms of strengthening our structures on the ground because, you know, when it comes to mergers, we have also handled the merger of 8 banks. So, it is not merely adding the balance sheets, it is ensuring the integration of the culture and also ensuring that the control structure is effective enough. So that is what my learning is from the mergers, but yes of course as a leading bank we have to be very mindful of what the competition is doing, and we are ensuring that we should stay ahead of the curve. Yeah, please."
sbin,"Sir, you have given the split of the AUCA numbers, 10 year and old 5,300, 5 year and old 68,481 crores and less than 5 years 1,02,471 crores – just a ballpark, just .....like these are all 100% provided for accounts. So, what as per your analysis, since you have given a detailed analysis of the break up, the aging wise, what can we roughly take as a recovery maybe in the next coming 2, 3 years or 5 years out of this 1 lakh 76 thousand crores Sir?","The recovery in AUCA is a function of the available security. So, there cannot be any ballpark figure for which we can ascribe for the recovery in AUCA. It is actually case to case basis and that is why our stressed assets resolution group is now actually addressing how to make the maximum possible recovery from these accounts."
sbin,"Sir, this is Anand Dama from Emkay Global. Sir, my question was on margins. For this quarter if you look at a quarter on quarter basis we have seen a 27 basis point contraction in terms of margins.","Again, quarter on quarter, let me just put across when it comes to NIM what will you
do for the one off that you get on the last quarter."
sbin,"as you know cross sales numbers are improving at 17%, but for a bank of our size, with the subsidiaries we have it should ideally be growing higher. So, have you considered open architecture instead of closed architecture when it comes to cross selling?","You know typically speaking we have to be very mindful of the kind of customers who walks into our branches and when we offer the product, we have to keep in mind what they expect. So, our assessment of the ground level situation is customers who walk into State Bank of India’s counters, they are looking at the product from State Bank group. They are not looking at the product from any other entity. So that is the strategy which we are following. But hopefully this number in the first quarter is not always all that great. We always know that insurance gets sold only in the last quarter of the financial year. So again, this is not a linear trend which we will get to see, quarter on quarter it will keep on changing. And last year we had seen a growth of about 30% and I am quite confident that this year also the growth will not be less than 30%, it will be rather more."
sbin,"Hi Sir - Sameer from JM Financials. Thanks for the opportunity. Sir, if I see other lines of fee income on a YOY basis, we kind of see bit of sluggishness with respect to loan processing charges etc. So how do you think the fee income lines moves through the year?","Loan processing charges, of course when we are looking at the quality book to be underwritten, the market dynamics actually forces to do that and not that it is going to be there forever. But yes of course, I would say it is more of a temporary situation."
sbin,If you could provide the slippage break up across segments?,"Slippage break up across segments...Yeah, I will just provide it...just one second. Our slippages were to the tune of about 7659 crores and retail personal was about 2400, Agri was 2300, SME was 2400 and out of this we have already recovered, pulled back about 700 crores in retail personal, Agri about 300 crores and 600 crores in SME."
sbin,"So, the recoveries are in 2Q basically or in the same quarter?",Yeah recoveries have happened in the month of July.
sbin," I’ve also looked at the slide where you’ve given the split of the business and other parameters. So, if you could just elaborate more on the business outlook over there and the margins?","International, we are very cautious. One, of course, because of the scenario in the global economies. And, one of the other reasons is, when we look at our international book, the India linked loans which are seen lower, is essentially on account of the fact that we had some... some oil companies had these revolving lines. So, they have not availed and that is one of the reasons. But, we are very very mindful in terms of the quality of risk. If at all I may say so, we go for cherry picking in our international book, which is not like our domestic book. And, there we operate absolutely like a corporate bank. And, asset and liability both are priced... they are linked to the variable rates. So, we have already seen the kind of movement in the FED rate, etc. So, SOFR and SONIA all are getting influenced by that, and that is one of the reasons why we see the kind of NIMs which we are seeing. But I would say that, over a period of time it will get normalised also, it will not remain at this level for the rest of the year."
sunpharma,"Sir, on the R&D expense front, given these set of trials to start for the products
you highlighted in the opening remarks. The full year guidance remains as it is, as you had highlighted
at the 4Q FY '23 comments?","Yes. I think as on today, you should consider the full year guidance. If there is a need
for us to make any change, we will update."
sunpharma,"Okay. And sir, other expenses, excluding R&D, have been sort of a bit volatile,
number varying from INR2,600 crores in Q1 FY '23 to going up to almost INR3,000 crores in 4Q FY '23
and now we are back to close to INR2,770 crores. So any particular line item which sort of deviates
with other expenses?","So in our Q4 call, we already said that the sales and distribution in previous calls
that these costs have some catch up and unlikely to escalate on the same pace going forward. There
may be sales-related growth in these expenses going forward."
sunpharma,"Okay. And just lastly, on the base business segment in the U.S. generics, what
kind of price erosion are we witnessing now?","No, I think, ultimately, the U.S. business dynamics, all of you are aware. And we
don't generally respond on specific product pricing or specific product sales."
sunpharma,"My question is again on the US, so not product specific, but if we exclude Taro and
specialty, you have seen a meaningful pickup sequentially. So can you explain what has led to it?","So I think what we have shared with you in the past is that we've made a proposal
to the Taro Board. And Taro Board, as a response to our proposal, has formed a special committee.
They need to finalize the lawyers and bankers and all of that, that special committee. And then, at
some point, the negotiation will begin. We have no further updates beyond what we have shared."
sunpharma,"Abhay, my first question is on Mohali. I'm assuming we would have seen some
impact from the Mohali consent degree and temporary suspension. Has that fully normalized?","So right now, the supplies from Mohali have not really started. Whether we will be
able to regain all the market share will depend upon the market dynamics and the number of
competitors and the length of the contracts that the buyers have signed up at the point that we enter
the market."
sunpharma,"And
should we expect any market share loss that we have had due to this temporary suspension to probably
at least regain a large part of it in the course of the year? How should we look at normalization of
supplies from Mohali?",So the second part is really difficult to estimate. We will see when we get there.
sunpharma,And is the supply restarting dependent on reinspection?,"Yes. I think there is no need for reinspection at this. Of course, for having the current
restrictions cleared, we will need a reinspection. But for restarting supply, there is no need for a
reinspection."
sunpharma,"And by when do you think both Mohali and Halol would be ready
for reinspection in your assessment?","I think once we informed the agency that we are ready for a reinspection, we will
share that information with all of you."
sunpharma,"Post the hold from the FDA on
the 12 mg, the 8 mg, have we slowed the pace of that also as we decide on what we're going to file,
etcetera?","So broadly, our understanding is that the partial clinical hold, which has been lifted
now, was for 12 milligram. So there is no slowdown in 8-milligram dosing."
sunpharma,"Sir, my first question is on the specialty business and that too the specialty
outside of US. So during this quarter, we have announced this Chinese partner, CMS, has got the
approval for Ilumetri. Congratulations there. So how bigger or how exciting development it is for us?","I think China can be an interesting market. Once we, I think, launch the product, we
will get a better sense. We believe that CMS, because of its significant existing linkage with
dermatologists, is quite well positioned to work for a good market share for the product."
tataconsum,"You grew 2x last year and this year also 50% growth in Soulfull. So wanted to understand here lot of the growth will be coming because of so much of diversification also and initially of course the pipeline filling is there for the new products. So you're saying the core business is also doing quite well, right?","So absolutely, Abneesh. I mean just like our overall business, our core has to do very well and then the expansions have to fire, right? So the whole equity of Soulfull has been built on breakfast cereals and we are moving out from there. Just like the TCPL algorithm is built on decent volume, strong categories, market share growth in tea and salt and that is helping us drive the rest of the portfolio."
tataconsum,"Is there a good movement or still because new products are getting launched, at an overall this 20% level the EBITDA margins, etcetera, may not have had a significant improvement versus say 3 years back?","So Abneesh, just as a perspective. The way we measure -- and there's a reason they’re called growth businesses because we do think they've got a long runway. Just as a perspective today my business is highly tea and salt in India and we moved from almost single digit to about 20% right now. Just as a perspective, that 20% is also dependent on seasonality because NourishCo remember fires very well in summer and that's one of the reasons why it has hit 20% from 15% where it was same quarter last year.
But you're absolutely right, the margin profile on some of the Growth businesses is not where it needs to be. That said, it will improve with scale and as we fine-tune our entire offering there. What we do measure is a) growth rate; b) the fact that the growth rate is getting fueled by the right amount of A&P and distribution; and lastly, the contributory margin has to continue to improve because essentially the thesis is that these are; for example Soulfull, Sampann; these are riding on my base logistics and S&D platforms and there is not incremental fixed cost that we are incurring out there. So as long as the contribution margin moves in the right direction, I am adding incrementality to the business."
tataconsum,"We have seen in some of the other categories where sharp deflation has happened, for example coconut hair oil or say detergent, there is a level of pipeline -- the inventory destocking because trade is expecting more of the price cuts. In salt, is there a price cut which you have taken and would you see that there will be a requirement of price cuts there? ","So Abneesh, the good and bad news is last year when everyone was facing inflation especially for businesses which were exposed to palm oil, crude, wheat or sunflower; we were not. In fact our tea prices were on a reverse trend. And therefore, we did not have as much of a price uplift in our portfolio. Right now what we are seeing is broadly flat to slightly marginal downtrend on tea. I would say right now we are braced for a flattish versus last year's sort of number, maybe slightly below, but that depends on how weather plays out especially in the north.
"
tataconsum,My first question is on the NourishCo business so that's almost INR300 crores this quarter. Can you discuss what's driving this growth and the kind of scale you expect for this business 2 to 3 years down the line?,"So Namant, essentially again the hypothesis in the NourishCo business was that great differentiated products, which could be scaled up significantly both with geographic expansion and portfolio expansion. So both geography and portfolio expansion is at play. I would say we are broadly in about 75%, 80% of the country in terms of production right now. Again hypothesis being that we will not drive more than 150 kilometers, 200 kilometers with these products because we play at affordable price points and therefore, freight is a very, very significant factor.
We have expanded portfolio. We have expanded into jelly for Gluco+, juice and jelly in PET. We have expanded into -- just like I said, we're expanding our mineral water play. Himalayan distribution and execution is off to a good start. Right now where we closed last year at INR300 crores -- sorry, INR600 crores, the target for this year is to hit a 4-digit number.
"
tataconsum,"And sir, could you talk about a few years down the line what kind of scale you expect in this business?","We do expect to see continued strong momentum in NourishCo, again I will say driven by geography and portfolio."
tataconsum,"I just wanted to understand the quick commerce channel a little better and wanted to hear your thoughts on this channel. So do you see this channel becoming sizable a few years down the line and what's the contribution this has to our business currently?
","All I can say is a lot of these trends you can see going up and down. Just like many people who were very, very bullish on the online space during COVID times and you can see lot of brands/businesses fading off in that space. All I can say is on a long- term basis consumers will move to convenience, consumers will move online and therefore, we remain committed to growing our total e-commerce business."
tataconsum,So how would the trade terms in quick commerce versus overall e-com or modern trade?,I would say we are competitive and that's why they make sure that we are well positioned in that channel.
tataconsum,"Just one quick question on NourishCo. That's a brand where we have also expanded our distribution reach significantly over last couple of years. So just wanted to understand from you that going forward in terms of growth mix, how do you see that being driven by distribution versus the product introduction/innovation?","So we're in about 80% of the country right now. We are still not present in large swathes of geography and large urban cities for example, right? We are still yet to build up distribution completely in Bombay, in Bangalore or Delhi. I mean we are picking and choosing where we want to play where we can get the fastest dime for the buck if I may speak so. But you're absolutely right. We still got a long way to go on distribution. But I would say in the near to medium term, we will complete the distribution gap and then it will be a game of 2 things: a, is building out strength in the outlets per se and expanding portfolio. On both these things, we've got a healthy pipeline lined up and therefore, we remain confident of continuing to deliver strong numbers in NourishCo."
tataconsum,"A couple of questions from my side. Sir, if we see both the top players in tea segment have delivered or indicated low single-digit growth versus category growth that you have shared of 7.9%. So are the regional players making a strong comeback?","
That said, just as a perspective, I think even in our report we have disclosed saying that Tata Agni, which plays at the bottom of our portfolio, has started to see strong growth. So in any business, I think walking the balance between margin and market share is a critical piece knowing when to trade off for what. If all things come together, then it's the magic of margin increasing and market share increasing. But quite a lot of the times, you've got to decide what you're going to trade off. But over the longer term, I would say you should see market share inching up continuously."
tataconsum,"So my understanding is that Bisleri, which is the largest player in this field, makes EBITDA margin somewhere in the low to mid-teens. They have their own manufacturing also. We don't. So if we are paying conversion charges, our margins would probably settle around that 10%, 11% kind of mark. What is wrong in my thought process here?","So essentially not all of Bisleri's manufacturing is owned. They operate through a significant amount of franchisees and independent distributors per se. That's number one. Number two, we are not only Tata Copper+. We are also Tata Gluco+, which is significantly higher margin and product that we -- and we are also Himalayan and we are launching products, which are significantly higher revenue, higher gross margin percentage and higher absolute gross margins per se. Number three, I would prefer to run with the route that we have chosen, which is franchisee producer -- or not franchise, co-manufacturers and distributors because then it is almost an infinite ROCE, right? And beyond a point, I do think we can get to a very, very decent EBITDA percentage, which is in the ballpark of where TCPL is today."
tatamotors,"When will this cancellation of “A” ordinary shares, let me just publish this question. Just give us a minute,
please. So, will the number of shares issued to “A” ordinary shareholders differ depending on the tax
liability for each category of investors, like mutual fund, individual NRI, and how do you intend to manage
it?","Yes, so the consideration that is going to be issued by Tata Motors will not change. So, the ratio will still
be 0.7. So, at a Tata Motors level, what is issued to the trust doesn't change. The trust then decides the
number of shares that it needs to sell to recover the withholding tax liabilities, bases the tax residencies
of each and every shareholder. And as you see from the table, the withholding tax liabilities are different
for different classes. So for domestic shareholders, it's 10%. Domestic shareholders form above 30% of
our shareholding base in “A” ordinary shareholders. You have mutual funds and insurance companies, the
withholding tax liability is 0%. You have FPIs at 17%, and then for NRIs, it's slightly higher, who are about
2% of our capital base. So yes, you are right from a Tata Motors perspective, the number of shares which are issued doesn't change, but the net that is received by the shareholders post the trust selling shares to
recover the withholding tax liabilities will differ."
tatamotors,"When will the cancellation of “A”
ordinary shares and issue of ordinary shares be done? ","Yeah, so, there are a host of steps that we need to go through before we reach that. As I explained, we
first need the SEBI NOC approval, post that we will be filing a petition with NCLT to admit the scheme. We
then go to an EGM, where it needs to be approved by the requisite majority of shareholders. Post that,
we need various other approvals from NCLT. We expect this to take anywhere between 12 to 15 months.
Once the NCLT approval is received, and we file the scheme with the ROC, the scheme becomes effective.
And the shareholders who are holders of “A” ordinary shares on the record date that is determined by
the Board of the Company after the NCLT approvals are received, their shares will get extinguished and
ordinary shares will get issued in lieu of that. it would be about 12 to 15 months."
tatamotors,"so what happens in between if share prices changes? No
impact at all because the consideration has been fixed today.","Yeah. So it's not a cash consideration. It's a relative ratio. So, irrespective of how the “A” ordinary shares
trade from here on, the ratio of 7 ordinary shares for 10 “A” ordinary shares doesn't change."
tatamotors,"how did you arrive at a
30% discount versus the 40% to 50% that's currently as shown in the PPT","Yes. So, interesting question. I think, probably the most challenging part of this equation, I think the
valuers, PWC, who were the valuers to this transaction and Citi and Axis who were the fairness opinion,
they put various angles on this number. I think at one hand, the perspective was that the “A” ordinary and
ordinary shareholders have the same economic rights, they have the same liquidation rights, other than
the voting rights, which are different. And for the voting rights, they were issued at a 10% discount
originally. And, on the other hand, for various market factors, the DVRs have traded at a deep, deep
discount of 50% or 40% and various other numbers, which is the other reality. I think they have given
weightage to both facets of the equation. And they've given different weightages, I guess, the market
factor is a reality, the economic equality was a reality at the time of issue. And basis their perception on
what the relative weightage for these factors were, they have arrived at a 30% discount."
tatamotors,"China growth
expectations is improving as per industry experts. How's the order book in China?","So, China, we'll sell more units in China this fiscal year than last fiscal year. Again, our big three products,
Range Rover, Range Rover Sport and Defender are selling very well into China, and we expect they will
continue to do so through the balance of the quarters, certainly through calendar year 2023. Order banks
don't build in China quite like they would do in UK and Europe. By the way, the customers do like stock on
the ground, so to some extent we actually see the ongoing order bank in China be fed by more product
actually being put into the marketplace, and Richard mentioned, that we are putting more product onto
the water to enable that in the second half of the year."
tatamotors,"The rest of your demand in various parts of the world, how are you seeing it develop?","I see. Okay, thank you, yeah. So we do see demand increase in the second half of the year, effectively, as
we supply more units. We will increase retails with more fulfillment. We're particularly strong at the
moment around those three products. And the biggest regions that really are pulling demand for those
three products are North America, Middle East, and reference back to the China comment as well.
So, particularly strong on our big three products in those three regions. And from what we can see, that
will continue for the balance of this year. And by the way, we should also say our variable marketing
stimulation on those products are very, very low, less than 1% in all of those three places. And their fixed
marketing for those products in those regions also are very, very low. So, should we get to the point at
the end of the year that it starts to turn off, we particularly on fixed marketing, which would always be
our preference. We have the ability to stimulate more orders by marketing means."
tatamotors,"So one thing on R&D capitalization, Richard, at your end went to 61%, a bit of flavor around it, and what
do you see to be a stable number?","Yeah, so look, our capitalization varies across our cycle. A few quarters ago, it was as low as 28% and 53%
and now 61%. And it's because we have a fairly concentrated product cadence in 2024 to 2026, so a lot of
our engineers are now working on programs at quite a late stage in their development cycle, and it's those
programs at the late stage of cycle that tend to get capitalized. So it's something that varies through our
cycle. We believe that sort of a long-term average, given where we are, it is more in the 50% to 60% range,
and we would expect to stay sort of at the type of levels that we are now for the next few quarters."
tatamotors,"We have not seen much
success of traditional global luxury car OEM’s EVs so far. What's your assessment of what's not working
for them, and how will JLR be different?","Yeah, thanks Balaji. No, so I think the observation behind the question is correct. And you have to segment
the question, I think, and feed it to its different regions. So I'm going to do that, and I'm actually going to
focus the answer on the China region, which is probably the most important changes in NEV, which is BEV
and PHEV over the course of the last 12 months or so. It's pretty clear at the moment that industry in
China, for NEV, I say BEV and PHEV, is really focused and concentrated around RMB 400,000 and below.
That's where the industry is taking off. So from the bottom of the product range, if that makes sense."
tatamotors,"In terms of order backlog for your EVs and ICE
portfolio, and what should be the industry VME given the kind of moderation and demand that you're
starting to see?","So, as far as order backlog for both EVs and ICE, in general it is, in general the waiting periods are in the
range of 3 weeks to 12 weeks, depending on the model and variant. As far as VME is concerned, the
industry has kind of a tale of two cities. There is the entry segment, which is facing demand pressure, and
for certain manufacturers, the inventory levels are high. So, there is definitely VME pressure, which is
building up, especially on the entry side. While on the other hand, the SUVs are going very strong with
very less need for any VME. Fortunately for us, in hatches, as I said, that we are doing well because of our
multi-powertrain strategy. So, as far as we are concerned, our VME has been kept under tight control still.
And, as and when the competitive situation demands that we need to do certain things for creation of
demand, we will do that."
tatamotors,what would be the effective tax rate that we should assume for JLR?,"Tax rate this quarter is 26%. At the moment we have a deferred tax asset that's not on the balance sheet.
UK long-term tax rates are 25%."
tatasteel,"Given where the spreads are, and given all these tailwinds from rolling-off of energy hedges and completion of blast furnace relining, could we possibly look at breakeven EBITDA for the entire European entity by the end of third quarter? ",We certainly expect the Netherlands business to be positive EBITDA in the second half. Plan for the year is for it to be EBITDA positive for the whole year. 
tatasteel,"Second question, on the European decarbonisation. In the presentation, it is mentioned the blast furnace 1 will be transitioned by FY30, when is the relining due for the other BF in Netherlands?","So firstly, in Netherlands, basically one blast furnace, which is called the BF6, is being relined. The bigger blast furnace, BF7, which produces 3.5 million tons, is up for relining maybe in 2026 - 27."
tatasteel,"Is it fair to say that now the $1 billion absolute net debt reduction guidelines that we had at the beginning of the year now would not stand and we should look more at Debt to EBITDA, which would mean that the absolute debt could be higher?","he Net debt to EBITDA is a frame that we are looking at. We will continue to push that, start getting the output of that kind of growth and continue to deleverage."
tatasteel,The energy hedges have actually been impacting numbers as you have highlighted. Could you just help understand generally like what is the periodicity of these hedges?,"So typically, we hedge, I think, 3 quarters at 25% every quarter. So that's why, in some sense, 1Q and 2Q would be the peak of what we hedged maybe 3 quarters back, right? In some sense, 1Q was a peak. You will see if I add the gas prices and electricity prices on a pound per ton basis, 1Q is the highest, 2Q will start dropping and then 3Q, 4Q will drop further. So that's pretty much a trajectory. Most of the drop will come in 2H. So that's why the benefits will accrue more in 2H than in 1H."
tatasteel,"First, can you explain better the BlueScope arrangement? ","Tata BlueScope is a 50-50 JV, which has been in force since FY06. And it is a very significant player in the coated products market, especially building systems and construction. So as per the JV agreement, all the coated products in the building systems space are being done or should be done by the JV. "
tatasteel,"So effectively, when we look at the release, then it moves from EBITDA to other income. Is that correct?","That's correct. The turnover goes, the EBITDA goes, and it goes to the other income."
tatasteel,"Is that possible to quantify, like what could be the hit of those hedges in 1Q?","Yes. So, we can share the details with you. And just to add, in FY22, actually, we benefited from the hedges. If you see how the spot prices had moved because we had hedges in place, our costs were actually much lower in FY23."
tatasteel,"What are your capex plans for FY24 and FY25, a split between India and Europe?","FY24, we have already said Rs. 16,000 crores. And I think about Rs. 11,000 crores out of that were supposed to be for India, if I remember right, largely Kalinganagar capex."
tatasteel,"This quarter, like at least from the reported P&L, I see that there's almost a $60 - $65 per ton QoQ improvement in the realisation. If I remember right, you had guided for a much lower, $15, or so. Is there any one-off in that?","But lastly, if I remember right, both the cost guidance and the net realisation guidance for 1Q compared to 4Q was pretty close to what we have guided."
tatasteel,What is the expected reduction in NRs in second quarter for India operations?,"We said about Rs. 3,100 per ton QoQ reduction."
tcs,"Just an extension of the generative AI discussion, we were having just now. So while you definitely talked a lot about the demand opportunity for the customers, I understand, you are also running multiple projects internally as well, to assess AI augmented processes, how they are going to save cost or productivity for you?","It’s difficult to call out some of this, but sufficient to say that, we have multiple teams, in almost every vertical that we have, who are working on pilots and internal projects. We are also working on how to craft the methodologies and toolkits to be meaningful to our clients, using This technology. All this is going on."
tcs,"Definitely quite exciting use cases there. Samir, during media interaction, you talked about clawing back some of the margin in the coming quarters. So, how do you see the trajectory of the claw-back?","With the current macro uncertainties, it would be difficult to estimate how exactly the margin recovery will play out quarter on quarter. But our focus would be to incrementally get closer to our aspirational band, improving our margins through each of the quarters and exit at a higher rate at the end of the year."
tcs,"Around two very strong quarters of TCV, now based on the deal ramp schedule, does this provide you with greater visibility of second half versus first half?","No. Our second half would depend on what happens in Q2 and how the momentum further builds over that. So, I do not believe that we are ready to call that second half is going to be better than first half. It is too early at this time."
tcs,My question is about fresher hiring. So was there any fresher hiring this quarter or was the recruitment mostly lateral to backfill that ?,No. We continue to hire freshers and we'll hire this quarter as well and that will continue.
tcs,Any particular investments on the consulting side to leverage the demand that you think from generative AI projects?,"We are building our in-house capability in Gen AI. We have our R&I team that is working on developing patents and very unique capabilities. We are leveraging our contextual masters, because we want to marry the technology capability with the domain capability delivery services."
tcs,"And on the manufacturing part, just a follow-up. Is it only the auto part of the manufacturing segment appearing stable at this point of time and looking to continue to spend?","No, we don't provide that detailed color. I think, excepting one, quite a few of the sub-verticals are doing well. And our outlook may not even apply for the overall industry, as we also have significant market share gain in this segment, which is also driving our growth."
tcs,One last question on contract profitability. How is that progressing?,"All our efforts collectively will be towards improving margins. But righ now, given the current macro, it's difficult to give a color in terms of how it would end up exactly. Rest assured all efforts are going towards improving the margins."
tcs,"Just the first question, a bit on the demand, maybe one more time. Krithi, of course, you've seen over your long time at TCS several demand cycles over the last 30 plus years. Is it possible To compare the current client behavior to any of the prior periods, such as perhaps post dotcom or GFC or taper tantrum or anything? ","I don't know if I can compare with any other cycle in the past. Every cycle has its own nuances. I would say today the way to look at the environment, there is an uncertainty because of which customers are reviewing or assessing the ongoing programs."
tcs,My next question is on last quarter's increase in onsite costs and whether that was due to new project starts. Have we continued to see new projects start this quarter and that got offset by some pressure on the book of existing business?,We saw new project starts with deal wins continuing to ramp up. We also had onsite movements happening incrementally in this quarter as well. And the net impact on revenue is due to the uncertainty on the existing projects or customers pausing their spend.
tcs,So manufacturing has held up quite well for us. So what is keeping this spend up in the manufacturing segment?,"I would say manufacturing is doing well because of the low base and the delayed pickup in demand and growth compared to other industries. And as the supply chain situation also eases slowly, customers are able to see the growth."
techm,Is that what we can conclude or do you think they are being more than mitigated by the kind of catch up spend that the industry has to do?,"I think in this case our work profile defines where the growth is coming from. So, a lot of our work profile is today driven by running the business platform. But especially as you know, on the auto sector, both on EV as well as on some of the platforms we have created, the warranties and some of the other solution platforms we've talked about, are becoming critical for the demand to be fulfilled in the auto sector, and though in discretionary spend, there is not much cut there, so in the auto segment at least we have that strength coming together."
techm,Is it possible to quantify the revenue impact of the client bankruptcy event in this quarter?,"So, revenue impact in this year is going to be none. But when you look at year-on-year, quarterly run rate of USD 6 million to USD 7 million."
techm,"As most of the margin levers which we are contemplating tend to be deflationary on growth, how to ensure growth without compensating on margins. How should we look at it?","So, first from an increment impact perspective for the quarter, as I mentioned, we did increment for a major chunk of the population. In terms of the margin levers, if you look at the subcon substitution or improvement on scale or other productivity benefit there really is a lever which is kind of independent from a growth perspective. The rest can be worked on as purely productivity measures that can help us as we think about margin expansion."
techm,Is the wage hike impact taken in the quarter partially or at least or that is still pending?,Majority of the wage increments already done in Q1. Only for certain senior proportion of the employee base - it will happen in the following quarter.
techm,"Are we any closer to closing some of those deals and how would that change the growth trajectory in Telecom, if at all towards the latter half of this year?",I think the deals are still in play. We are still in discussions at various stages.
techm,"Just want to understand CME, if you can provide some detail on sub- segment where we are seeing more weakness and how do you expect that to play out over next
few quarters? ","Most of the trends that we see in terms of discretionary digital transformation spend as well as the cost transformation are pretty uniform across the major Tier-1 operators across the world. That said, while we are very well placed with many of these companies to continue to take advantage of their initiatives, we probably will go through some of these headwind days and quarters. "
techm,"So, is it sales driven investments that you are upfronting or are there some element of support staff addition here?",That's part of our leadership program hiring that we do for campuses with annual exercises. It's more driven by that.
techm,"If we look at the top 10 client fairly resilient whereas CME is very weak. So, typically CME used to have a higher client
concentration and some of the clients were part of our top 10. So, if you can provide some more details about divergent trends between these two?","Inside the top 10 clients we were seeing some pressure in couple of our top customers in the last couple of quarters. And that we had said is getting closer towards bottoming out. So, that's happened, and we are seeing some positive momentum there. The closure of the projects that we mentioned in Network Services within CME were more outside the top 10 customers, one probably closer to the top 20 and the other was even below that. So, I think that's what is causing a reduction, which is leading to the decrease and then overall discretionary spend cut across the board beyond these couple of project closures which have one-time impact. Hence, you don't see that in the top 10, where it's more stabilized view now"
techm,"The second is that in an environment like this where a lot of these short-term projects are getting rolled off. And there's a lot of discretionary cut. Last six months TCV generally decides the revenue trajectory, which has been weaker for us. So, what gives you confidence that the growth may come back or this is kind of the bottom in terms of performance?","Number two for the cost transformation, I would rather take a medium-term outlook than a very short-term outlook. Short term outlook is very simple, cut a few layers and you can right size it almost on an urgent basis. "
techm,"On margins based on the portfolio we have today, can we assume that we have reached the bottom of the margins and a subpart to it, as you mentioned that the subcontracting expenses could be less than 10% of the revenue so is that the priority for current year or is it a priority over the next 12-18 months?","And on the margin question from a subcon standpoint, we've reduced that from 16% to 14% over the last three, four quarters and will continue to work on it as we've articulated, our entitlement mark is getting to 10% and below. Given where we are, we will continuously drive that in the next few quarters to get to that level. And see that opportunity flow through from a benefit standpoint over the next 3-4 quarters."
titan,"Now especially in the jewellery segment, given this quarter's jewellery performance, would you need to revisit the expectations of 12.5-13% jewellery margins FY24 as the competitive intensity necessitates a more aggressive pricing stance?","Our guidance of 12-13% for jewellery remains. We are pretty much -- and that is for full year, not every quarter. And if you also look at history of our performances across quarters, there has been evidence of Quarter 1 versus full year number being different. So it is not that something out of the place."
titan,So you mentioned you expect handsome profit growth during the year. Any target which you can share? ,"Yes, you are right. I think last year was, in a way, slightly not that normal year from the margin point of view. We have been telling that consistently all the 4 quarters. So revenue growth will be likely to be better than the earning growth in this financial year."
titan,"We've seen a slight moderation in growth from 50% plus levels to 30%, close to that. And you've also seen some decline in margins sequentially. Can you share your thoughts on growth and margins going forward?","Actually, it's after a very long time that this kind of a slightly lower than our, what we used to has happened. And because of that lower growth on the one hand, but continuing investments that we are making in people, assets, and technology that the margin has actually fallen. But it's just one quarter. So the prospects for CaratLane are exceptional, and we are committed to sort of coming back to that growth rate in Q2 itself."
titan,What is the market share target or in the medium to long-term aspiration we are holding at this time?,"We think we can aim to get to a double-digit market share in the next 3, 4 years. "
titan,"Can we get some volume numbers so out of 13% growth in the business, what is the volume growth in the analog?","So the interplay between volume, value, analog and wearables and also the premium brands and the mass brand, is quite a complicated kind of thing. At this point, I think that's what I would leave you with."
titan,"First is on the margins, but again on jewellery. So let's say this quarter, you did about 11%. For the guidance of, let's say, what you gave in the last quarter of 12.5-13%, if I assume 12.5%, at least 13% margins for the rest of the year. Is that what is looking reasonable right now to you?","Several time we have reiterated our guidance is 12-13%, but somehow or the other 12.5-13% has got stuck in this community's mind. The 12-13%, and that is what we would continue to aim for."
titan,"In the capital employed, we have seen against a INR 2,437 crores, our capital employed has gone up by almost INR 700 crores. So is it primarily because of the international portion or there is some element sitting in?","There is some element of inventory buildup as well as some element of debtors. Again, this is quite complex because we have differential sales in different channels. And our sales and channels, especially marketplace e-com and large format stores has been higher than budget, and that has led to higher receivables"
titan,How much more capital will we be infusing in both these divisions?,"From a profitability standpoint, they are all doing pretty much better than what we had planned, while obviously, the costs are higher in operating these stores in international markets, the GC profile that we are getting from the stores are also substantially higher with the U.S. being even better than the GCC market."
titan,The next question would be on Titan Eye+. How much is e-commerce as a percentage of sales?,"Our e-commerce contribution is in the ballpark of 6%, 7%, both combined our in-house brand channel as well as through Flipkart, Amazon. Flipkart, Amazon, we mostly sell sunglasses that too lower end, Fastrack products. And so focus is more on the in-house e-comm channel. The last quarter compared to the previous quarter e-com in-house channel has almost doubled in terms of its sales."
titan,"Based on your experience so far, are you able to kind of get a sense or quantify what is the extent of additional growth that you can achieve if you make the gold exchange program, zero default gold exchange program more or less the default policy around the year?","We'll have to work on it. We're not so sure because many of these things are iterative. When we've tried to innovate, settle down to a gold exchange program policy, which Is consistent across markets, but they are very difficult to estimate whether because of the program being that way or is it better to do it tactically as offers from time to time because it creates a certain call to action when you do that."
ultracemco,What would have been our alternate fuel usage in this quarter?,Not sure how much. 5%.
ultracemco,How do you see alternate fuel usage progressing?,"We have taken a target to grow up to 9% to 10% by the end of next fiscal year. Lot of investment was required, which we have taken up in this financial year, close to INR250 crores."
ultracemco,"One on the entire renewable energy, just want to understand would UltraTech, I know this is a subsidiary, Aditya Birla Renewable Energy but would be the growth of UltraTech be putting capital to this or will you buy it from outside?","So first and foremost, we will do a group captive scheme. So we have to participate with about INR297 crores of equity into the SPV. "
ultracemco,Can you please guide us what kind of drop in the like pet coke prices we can visualize in the coming quarters? ,"Very difficult, very difficult. If you can tell me what the index will be after 2 days and I will tell you what our price is. Can you? To be honest, it's very volatile. Within 10 days, the prices have galloped up from 110 to 125, which can come down also, it can go upwards. So I have no idea."
ultracemco,"Is it fair to say that the next phase of expansion could be like more greenfield and therefore, the cost could be a bit higher?",No. We will because it will be continue to remain a mix. And if I look at my next phase I was just doing a mental math on what is happening. So it will still be a mix of green and brown and cost will be very competitive.
ultracemco,"In terms of capex, what is the capex we will need? Is it just the INR300 crores that you set the equity investment or...","Yes, that will be our participation."
ultracemco,"In terms of growth on clinker, are we operating close to 100% utilization now given you on cement cases itself, you are at 90% for the quarter. So can you give some sense of our clinker utilization?",It's more than 90% for sure. Actually it is more than 90%.
ultracemco,"In terms of the WHRS so currently 232 and we say 425 by FY '26, so by FY '24 or by FY '25, if you can help us how much more we will be adding...?","We will have By FY '24, we'll reach 300 and I think between '25 and '26, the remaining obviously."
ultracemco,"For the balance, the 58% of our fuel outside Pet coke, what is the price trend there?","Maximum is imported coal. We also have our FSA, which is the linkage coal, but maximum is imported coal. So if I were to look at percentages then So 46% is imported coal, 7% indigenous coal, 42% Pet coke, 5% alternate fuel and lignite."
ultracemco,"So broadly on from now onwards, we should be seeing improvement in EBITDA per ton on Q-o-Q basis?","Yes. Most certainly. Q2 I hope, in spite of monsoon, maintenance costs, I think we should do well."
upl,"And given that it will probably acquire 20% or 25% volume growth to achieve that given that pricing is probably going to be negative to the tune of at least 10 percentage points or thereabouts. So, do you expect that sort of volume growth to be an achievable target in the second half?","So, I would expect in Q2 that we'll see somewhat of a similar price decline that we saw in Q1, which is in that high single-digit range. And so that is likely to persist In Q2 for us. I think volumes won't be nearly as impacted as they were in Q1. So that would kind of give you a sense that even though Q2 will be subdued, it won't be to the same magnitude as we saw in Q1."
upl,We understand that they've increased their capacity substantially in some of your key products. Do you see them reducing their competitive intensity in coming quarters or would you see the overcapacity there as a bit of a structuraL problem?,"I think once capacity comes online, it's more of a permanent fixture. Right now, what we're seeing is very low demand coming into the market in China. Again, this change in buying habits by distribution is impacting, I would say, across the industry, whether they be Chinese producers or across the rest of the multinational companies as we're seeing other companies report their results from this past quarter. Look, on a go-forward basis, I think the competition will be intense."
upl,"Do you think channel inventory is running is more than usual levels, like if it looks like X, at the usual time are we running lower than those levels right now?","Yes. So, look, the reality is it's really a country-by-country, market-by-market situation. I was in the U.S. just a couple of weeks ago visiting with key distributors across the U.S. And I would say, largely, the inventory levels are at what I would call normal levels for most companies. There were a few distributors I talked to that still had higher-than-desired inventories."
upl,My first question is with respect to the debt. Could you give us the gross debt and net debt figures in INR terms for Q1 this year versus last year?,"It's essentially on the slide 11, if you look at the quarter one presentation that's there on the website. The numbers are INR 30,083 crores in June '23, and similar number, June '22 was INR 30,123 crore. However, if you see in dollars, it was $3.66 billion versus $3.81 billion, so down by about $147 million."
upl,"And lastly, on the product ban in Europe, anything you would like to quantify in terms
of what is the impact that you are gaging?","So, the one product that was banned last year that we're not able to sell any longer this year is an active ingredient called bifenazate. It's a very nice product for us, high margins. "
upl,"And second question on the India business. How are we anticipating the on-ground
consumption after this recent bout of pickup in rainfall for the current Kharif season?","I think after the lack of rainfall we had in June; I think it's good that things have moved in India, and we are seeing good rains now. "
upl,"In the last quarter, if I look at Q4 '23, it was $2.7 billion. So, I wonder if you are like now counting some maybe factoring or what was the driver of that increase in debt? ",We always compare net debt with corresponding quarter of the previous year rather than a quarter-on-quarter comparison.
upl,Is the entire increase from $2.8 billion to $3.6 billion driven by working capital?,"So, it certainly will get reversed in Q4 as I said, Q4 is when most of our cash collection happens. Also, as I mentioned earlier, about INR 8,000 crores of build-up was therein working capital. There have been certain investments and the tax and other payments too."
upl,And how do you see sort of evolution and basically time given by the rating agency to sort of get back to a full sustainable sort of business?,"I think the good part is –that the rating agencies have been rating various other crop protection chemical companies, and they do know the market conditions. In Q4, they maintained their rating. As more and more information started making available on China as well as some of the other companies came up with their results, they understood the market conditions."
upl,May I just understand that your revised EBITDA forecast includes this cost reduction or is this an upside that potentially might come about if these are on track?,We have included this cost reduction in our 3% to 7% EBITDA increase guidance.
wipro,"So based on your client conversations, what is the key concern or key variable that you are gathering?","I really like the question you just asked. I think it's a real one. And so let me try to respond to that. Interactions with clients have more or less, I would say, a similar pattern, which is that on one end, there is no one question the fact that technology is critical to the success of the evolution of the company, whatever the industry is, by the way."
wipro,"The USD 1 billion investment commitment in AI over three years, is it fair to assume it will be largely in the M&A route?","No, it's not fair. Actually, the majority of it will be organic."
wipro,"So first, Thierry, if you think about the cut in discretionary versus, let's say, the lower ACV of deals versus what we would have seen in the prior two years, which do you think is a more significant driver of the weakness?","I'm not sure I can easily answer your question, whether it's discretionary or ACV. By definition, what is ACV and not showing a difference with TCV is by definition short-term deals and that includes mostly discretionary spend. So I would say, you can call it the way you want. Those are short-term deals versus large deals, basically."
wipro,"So on the utilization, you think, you have more room because it already seems to be maxed out. So would you need to start hiring in anticipation of demand, maybe six months down odd?","Yes, utilization clearly is going to continue to be a KPI that will keep driving. We are also looking at different components of utilization, not only the aggregate number in terms of location, in terms of seniority. So yes, there is still some room to drive our utilization up from where we are."
wipro,Second question is regarding the investment committed for generative AI. How are we going to fund this investment? ,"So, funding is funded by the operations, to be clear. So this is in our plan. It's baked into our plan. To explain to you a few minutes ago that, there's a lot going on in terms of, improving the efficiency of our operations, of what we call our operational excellence, whether it's in the way we are, injecting more automation and AI into our delivery to be more efficient, or whether it is in the way, we are, streamlining of our operations, reducing the layers, and just being more nimble and more agile as an organization."
wipro,"Considering the demand environment, how would you characterize the competitive intensity that you see in the market today compared to, say, six months back?","So, it is a very competitive environment as we look to renew our existing book of business and
acquire new clients with new opportunities."
wipro,"Is the higher competitive intensity impacting pricing as we speak right now, or is the customer able to extract sweeter deals from you in terms of larger productivity benefits down the road?","No, the answer right now is yes, in the sense that there is nothing unusual that we see on large deals that we don't normally notice. Obviously, if there is a USD200 million or USD300 million deal, you would benchmark it with the best standards on productivity, best standards on pricing, but that is not out of ordinary behavior of dropping prices or giving deferrals in billing, etcetera. Those behavior, we have not yet observed that would worry us."
wipro,"Will the productivity gains that people claim or there's been claims around it, will that be entirely passed on to customers resulting in some kind of revenue compression in the times ahead?","But as you already know that, every competitive deal goes with a certain assumptions of year-on-year productivity numbers that are baked in and those numbers will continue gradually. They will continue to bake in the productivity benefits that Gen AI will bake in"
wipro,"So in terms of how the last quarter turned out, was there any stabilization towards the second half of the quarter or the weakness of the system through the quarter?","This is a difficult question. I'm not sure I can answer. It's too early to tell, right? You cannot make a trend based on 20 days or 30 days. I think it's, this is the reality with the context of uncertainty. It is precisely, it's a little bit erratic. And so, some industries certainly are more pushers than others. Banking, financial services, technology, you see that. technology has reduced."
wipro,I just want to clarify regarding the billion dollar investments which you guys have announced in Gen AI. Can you give some sense on where the majority of this investment will be routed to? ,"So, we have a very comprehensive plan, of course, behind the USD1 billion, Mukul. And it includes, it's about investing into solutions, into assets, into accelerators, into capabilities, into methods, and it's across the organization. It's also about training. There's a lot of aspects of these investments and of course, as well, M&A."

 ""Liquidity buffer continues to remain strong at INR12,700 crores, keeps hovering between INR12,000 crores and INR15,000 crores in any quarter. That's really where it is.

We have demonstrated over the last 4 quarters itself. And the diversified balance sheet profile. The net impact of NII, sequentially if you look at, it was 11 basis points.

"As per the Annual Report disclosure, the unsecured portfolio ECL coverage has gone to 75%. It used to be around 77% odd during COVID. Sir, could you provide some color around that?","The unsecured portfolio ECL coverage has decreased slightly from around 77% during COVID to 75% currently. This change in coverage may be due to the composition of the balance sheet and the different levels of provisioning required for overdue accounts. Despite this decrease, the provisioning coverage ratio has been strengthened across businesses, resulting in a minor impact on the overall financials.","[""In fact, change is one thing that, as we said, Rural B2C grew 21%. Actual Rural B2C PL grew only 19%, so just to clarify, just an added point. We think if INR5,000 crores is a rightful number, to us to create a separate quadrant in terms of portfolio quality disclosure. Otherwise, it's -- so that's the number you should look for. Whenever we separate it, you should know that assets have reached INR5,000 crores. Otherwise, they're clustered together, for convenience, other than anything else.\n\nShweta Daptardar: Understood.

It would be helpful if you could tell us how those graphs are looking like today. Or if you could disclose even future and net appreciation. And just as empirical evidence, how many customers would you have ended up projecting this quarter, both existing and new, simply because of this overleverage issue? Yes.\n\nRajeev Jain: In general, if I would take a funnel view, those customers to whom I gave B2B don't default it all. Of that, I land up offering a personal loan only to 60%. Eventually, I land up giving to 40%. That's the funnel view, all the way from B2B to conversion to a B2C. All pristine, right? Did not default, went through the filtration for B2B.""]","I was just saying, the number has remained range bound only, right. It's 75%, 77%. So nothing has changed materially.

So that's the first one. The second one is essentially on the attrition rate.

 ""Let me make a point. People talk about compensation and engagement and so on and so forth. We came -- we became very clear that the entire effort is in process simplification, which takes more time for an employee to be at work. That's really where line by line we've worked over the last 15 months, business by business, and that's how the number came down from 28% to 19% and first quarter is looking at 13.8% and the work continues.

What is the secret pill behind very low senior management attrition? Till date we have only seen Ashish Sapra going out and Devang Mody going out and again coming back. So, what is the secret sauce behind the senior management attrition, especially when we have such a large player Jio willing to hire from anywhere else, and we are seeing so much of attrition across levels and banks. That's the first. Second is on the collection infrastructure, if you can spell out how many people we have in collections on roll, off-roll so on, and how they are split business wise.\n\n# Rajeev Jain:""

First quarter annualized attrition is at 13.8%. Last year same time, it was 14.5%.\n\nWe took a decision last year actually. The year before if you look at it, it was 28%. We took a decision that we need far greater stability across all levels of management, and that's why a set of management decisions were taken and they yielded a 19% annualized attrition last year. And this year, the first quarter trajectory at this point in time is looking further down from last year.""]","So, the approval rates would look closer to '19, '20.

So, the rest of the product, rest of the percentage we define basis, our appetite as well as the opportunity to maximize return.

And as I said in the AGMs, just 2 hours ago, the -- one of the things that we're very happy about is that our -- across these 9 lines of businesses, there's been no shift in the last 6 years in terms of mix that has ensured that we've delivered scale, it's ensured we've delivered consistent profitability, it's ensured we've delivered stable risk metrics. And I'll -- also said in AGM that I don't foresee these bricks changing too significantly. That's all.\n\nProbably 1 or 2 percentage points here and there, but largely, if I look at the last 5, 6 years, the mix largely remains very same or similar.

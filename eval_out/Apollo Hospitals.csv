And while we tapered down certain volumes in Q1 started March to till end of June. But I think, we've got various other initiatives to ensure that we fill the gap quickly with new set of customers, new offerings and we increase the average order value. In fact, our average order value has also gone up in spite, if you could look at it, INR 845 previous year versus INR 935.

 ""Yes, we can in those regions. So overall, as a Company, maybe not. But I think in each of the regions where we touch 70%, we should be able to sustain.\n\n# A. Krishnan:\n\nYes. And to also add on to your point, as we said about the new hospital brands, which we are doing you know the 2,000 beds and INR 3,000 crore over the next 3 years, the first stock of beds are coming in the two regions where we have more than 75% occupied, one is Kolkata and the other is Bangalore, which we are looking at. So these are the 2 that will start off. Then we are looking at Gurgaon, which will follow in the year after that, where again, our occupancy is over 75%. So, we are quite clear about how we are looking at the strategy of expansion. Those are new markets. These will not impact our existing occupancies at all.\n\n# Naushad Chaudhary:\n\nI understand. I'm just trying to understand on the blended level, 70% is doable on a sustainable basis or not, on a blended level?\n\n# A. Krishnan:""

 ""# Suneeta Reddy:\n\nI think when we are looking at doubling, yes, we are adding beds to ensure that we have beds to fill.

 ""Suneeta Reddy: So Chennai is clearly, is there now in terms of, so people are still traveling to Chennai for quaternary care. What is good is that our Tier 2 hospitals also are doing much better.

And my last question, I'll keep it brief. We added, I think, 900 stores last year. We have added 30 stores in the first quarter. So, I just want to understand what's our target for this INR 10,000 crore, don't we need additional stores, or we think we're going to have a much lower run rate this year?""

And then how should we see the EBITDA percentage improving with relation to GMV over the next couple of years?,"The EBITDA percentage is expected to improve with relation to GMV over the next couple of years as the operating expenses are anticipated to decrease with cost reduction efforts. As the GMV grows, the EBITDA to GMV conversion is projected to increase, leading to a narrowing of losses in the business.","[""Sanjiv Gupta: This is a little tricky. But I think the way we look at it is that whatever level of expenses we have it in the digital segment itself, those expenses we used to, we (inaudible) get out of the (inaudible) or the (inaudible) rate that we have it in, on the GMV. So yes, the expenses have started going down. In the future, depending on which particular vertical we intend to invest, there will be a little bit of delta over there. But otherwise, the thought process that the digital alone itself $1 billion could be able to take care of the expense (inaudible).

 ""Nitin Agarwal: So I guess the way to look at this thing is this INR 175 crore number is a top-ish number. It keeps probably coming down with the cost reduction as we go forward.

That's the direction that we have started working on, too.\n\nNitin Agarwal: And in the next couple of years, when say the GMV goes to close to $1 billion and all that you talk about, I mean at what level do the operating expenses begin to peak out or sustain at around when you start to get to $1 billion in GMV?""

It used to be about 6% to 7%, 6.6% of the margin to the revenue in Q1 FY23. It went up to 7%, 9% and 9.7% over the previous quarters. This quarter, it is 10.89%.

 '# Harith Ahmad:\n\nIs this revenue-to-GMV ratio that we should be factoring going forward, around 20%, 30%?\n\n# Sanjiv Gupta:\n\nI think it should be better.

And secondly, the overall margin numbers are also closely governed by how raw material prices pan out in the market. You have seen that during the whole period of inflation, when the inflation levels had gone to about 20-25-30% levels, despite taking price increases, the PBDIT margins had gone almost to about 15-16% levels.

 ""Amit Syngle: What we see is that today the opportunities obviously in terms of the dealer and retail points is that we keep on looking at not only the smaller towns which are coming up, but we are also looking at a lot of suburbs of the bigger cities, which are expanding. So, it's a combination of looking at retail points coming at both these points. What we also feel is that today, it's a journey in terms of how the retailers start. They might do a certain amount of business in a year and they kind of keep on growing progressively over the next 3-5 years and therefore the drop out of a dealer, from the point of view of year one dealing with us to kind of going to year three, year four is not very high because we look at putting in a tinting mechanism, which gives them the flexibility of earning more money given the fact that the retailer is able to cater to a larger range of SKUs which he can offer to the customer.""
 'In our experience, what we feel is that this is a kind of journey which will continue given the vastness of our country and given the opportunities of now the larger road network, government infrastructure, the way it is developing. I think the opportunities are fairly huge. For example, if you look at the entire J&K portion today and the opportunities that have opened are very big. Similarly, look at North East, given the connectivity of roads which is coming. So, I think these areas of expansion are going to continue and we feel that right from year one onwards, people get their ROI because at Asian Paints, we offer them a very, very high rotation of inventory and they keep on growing as the years go by. Some 5% of the retail network might drop out because of some liquidity crunch or some other personal problems which might come in. But overall, I think the business model is pretty strong.'

You are happy with 30% growth rate for this Kitchen and Bath business? You don't have aspirations for doubling of business year on year. Like, if you have those aspirations, what are the bottlenecks for doubling or multi fold growth in this category?\n\nAmit Syngle:""
 ""Happiness is a relative state of mind. I might be happy with tripling business also going forward, but you need to be practical in terms of the way you want to grow and not really strain the system. We have just put additional capacity for both the Kitchen and the Bath which has come up in Maharashtra so that we are able to really put a strong impetus. Going forward, we are happy if we are able to grow the business by about 25-30% each year. That's a fairly healthy rate in terms of growth. In terms of what we see. I think the idea here is that you look at strong consumer propositions and you look at possibly equipping your stores in terms of really carving a niche for yourself. So, I think we are taking really measured calls in terms of the way we want to kind of go. And as I said, I think we should be happy in terms of getting about 25-30% growth in this segment, which should be a good indicator in terms of our overall growth. We have always said that going forward, the whole Home Décor segment should be""
 ""# Amit Syngle:\n\nWhen you look at the last three years of journey, first year in Kitchen and Bath, we grew almost about 35%. Second year again, we would have grown at about 30-35%. Last year we grew almost about 10-15%. So last year was a bit slow and this year in the first quarter, we are seeing to some extent the business slowing down because of the large base.\n\nSo, I would not say that the business has not grown. I think last three years, the combined business of the two entities is close to about Rs. 830 crores. Therefore, this business has grown from about Rs. 500 crores to about Rs. 830 crores, and I think that's a good increase, which we have seen in the last three years.""

 ""Puneet Sharma: Saurabh, thank you for the question. Yes, there has been a 5% moderation in LCR. But I'm not clear on how that translates to the 15 basis points that, of normalized reduction that you're coming to. On a reported basis, we have declined net interest margins by 12 basis points, 9 basis points of the 12 basis points is BAU, which is cost of deposits being offset by increase in yield on investments and advances. And 3 basis points in the last quarter was a one-off item, which is interest on income tax refunds, which doesn't repeat itself in quarter 1. So the bridge for the 12 basis points is the 9 basis points-plus 3 basis points.\n\nPage 12 of 18\n---\n# Axis Bank Limited\n\n# July 26, 2023\n\nAmitabh Chaudhry: On attrition, let me say a couple of points.

The demographics, the current penetration, which in many parts of Africa and Latin America is in single digits compared to triple digits in India.

For example, with respect to companies whenever there is a need of spot cargoes, generally M minus 2 they will go to the market. At a particular point of time if there is no demand for that cargo, the discounts can go up. For example, if there is a good demand from the buyer's side, the discounts will be on a lower side.

First question is on how do you see the impact of Jio Bharat phone on the feature phone market?,"The impact of Jio Bharat phone on the feature phone market is being observed in the early stages. The feature phone market currently represents about 18% of overall revenues, with customers typically replacing their feature phones once every four years. While the pricing of the Jio Bharat phone is competitive, the focus for Bharti Airtel Limited is on encouraging feature phone users to upgrade to smartphones through bundling offers and cash backs. Bharti Airtel does not plan to launch a similar device as they believe their current 2G network and existing feature phones in the market cater to the needs of their feature phone users.","['Kunal Vora – BNP Paribas\n\nThanks for the opportunity. This is Kunal Vora from BNP Paribas. First question is on how do you see the impact of Jio Bharat phone on the feature phone market. Would you look at or you could use a similar device and like if you can share your experience with the devices in the past, like you had one with Karbon few years back.\n\nGopal Vittal - Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer, Bharti Airtel Limited'
 'I would say that it is early days, I think that even when it was launched last time we did see an impact, at that point in time the feature phone market was much larger than what it is today. Today the feature phone segment accounts for about 18% of our overall revenues, and more importantly it is only once in four years that a customer chooses to replace the feature phone. The pricing of this device is slightly higher than the cheapest feature phones, it is competitive. So it is early days I would say that our agenda is straightforward we continue to focus on our upgradation from feature phones to smartphones that is where we are doubling down actually doing a lot of bundling doing some modest cash backs in the form of loans to customers with a locked device because we believe that ultimately these feature phone users must upgrade to smartphones. So that is really where our focus is. So we would not be launching any such device, I think our feature phone user is on our 2G network, and our focus really will'
 'Kunal Vora - BNP Paribas\n\nSo why would you not do it, I mean, what do you see a reason to not go for a device like this.\n\nGopal Vittal - Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer, Bharti Airtel Limited\n\nBecause largely these devices are only used for calling and we do not need to get into this device segment that is already there in the form of a feature phone.

 'Yes, I think it is a good question, a big increase in ARPU can only happen with a reset of the tariff table, and as you know we are at the lowest levels of the world both in terms of rate per GB on data as well as average revenue per user on both. If you go to plot rate per GB of data on the X-axis and average revenue per use on the Y-axis, India will be at the bottom left-hand corner relative to all the other markets in the world including markets in South Asia or sub-Saharan Africa or anywhere in the world. So the big increases will really come from a tariff reset, but within the confines of the challenges that we operate with in a competitive market we have seven levers like I mentioned I think prepaid or feature phone to smartphone you get a ARPU upside, the entry level feature phone price plan is at Rs 155, the entry level smartphone pricing where you offer meaningful amounts of data is Rs 239. So you do see a almost a 50% jump as people move from a feature phone to a smartphone, and that is a function']","I would say that it is early days, I think that even when it was launched last time we did see an impact, at that point in time the feature phone market was much larger than what it is today.

 'that they use on this little device that we carry in our pockets is really messaging or some video or some browsing, and as a consequence 4 to 6 Mbps is more than adequate and it is at a point of indifference beyond that. So if you get more than 4 Mbps you are at a point of indifference unless you are downloading a heavy file or downloading a heavy game or something like that so I think we are in the game fully and the way we look at the deployment is really to make sure that we are giving a seamless experience regardless of the technology a great data experience right across the city, a great voice experience right across the city, and continue to offload 4G capacity investments into 5G. So that we do not spend a single dollar on 4G anymore and all our investments are geared towards 5G.

"If you can share your thoughts on 5G monetization, and if you can provide any data on how many users, what kind of usage, what proportion of volumes are on the 5G network now?","5G monetization is seen as a significant opportunity for growth. The capacity of 5G is estimated to be roughly 4 to 5 times that of 4G, providing substantial upside potential. Currently, the 5G network is relatively empty with ample room for expansion. The focus on postpaid services is considered a key growth area, with only about 6% of users currently on postpaid plans. There is a belief that India will gradually shift towards postpaid services, presenting a high upside opportunity. Additionally, the transition of users from competitors to their network, especially early adopters seeking 5G, is viewed as a growth lever. Overall, the 5G network is expected to play a pivotal role in attracting users and driving monetization opportunities for the company.","['Like I mentioned Kunal we are seeing about 30% of offload, so in a site where there is both 4G and 5G depending on the devices, and depending on what the traffic is, we see up to a 30% offload of this traffic from 4G networks to 5G networks. It is still early days because the overall installed base is still low it is 14%-15% it is not grown at the rate that we were expecting it to grow. Even today 5G shipments are only about 48% of the total shipments. So it is still moving slowly and it will take time for the full upgradation to happen. The way I think about monetization as I mentioned is at an aggregate ARPU level. So for us the monetization levers is feature phone to smartphone, prepaid to postpaid, data monetization, and finally of course if there is a tariff increase, and that gives you a monetization as well. The capex that we are putting in is largely on 5G we are not putting any 4G capacity capex other than the rollout of rural sites, which is really a coverage related capex. So the way we look at'

 'So for the same block or spectrum whatever is the capacity of 4G, 5G would have a capacity which is roughly between 4 to 5 times. Let me try and explain this in a different way Sanjesh. On average we have about 50 to 60 megahertz of spectrum across the country deployed on 4G, and the petabytes that we have on our network. You also know that we are still not a congested network, we still have headroom from further capacity even on a 4G network. So let us assume that the capacity utilization is 60%-65% which means that based on the petabytes that we are pumping out you can see what is the upside on that same tranche of 50 to 60 megahertz. Here you have got a 100 megahertz spectrum. So number one is a double of the spectrum, so you can straight away double that, number two is it is more spectrally efficient. So you get another 50% to 60% increase in that. So therefore I think that there is a long runway for 5G to start filling up. It is a empty network and it will remain so for some time to come.'
 'As I already mentioned in my opening comments, I think postpaid we believe is a big opportunity. Today about 6% of our users are on postpaid. If I look at markets like Thailand that number is well past the teens, if I look at markets like Brazil it is almost 40% to 50%. So the upside opportunity in postpaid is clearly high, and I think India over a period of time will start moving more and more towards postpaid that has to happen. The levers of growth for us are number one of course is prepaid and postpaid that is one lever of growth where we see an increase in ARPU, the second lever of growth is switching a user from a competition to us and I think 5G tends to play a role where the early adopters of smartphones were looking for a 5G Network want to prefer us, so that there is an opportunity here because one of the player has not launched 5G, so that is clearly an opportunity, and the third opportunity is really around what we saw with Verizon almost over a decade ago, which is the great success that they']",It is still early days because the overall installed base is still low it is 14%-15% it is not grown at the rate that we were expecting it to grow.

"Second question is on your rural expansion program, can you give us a progress and how has been the response as you roll out new sites there?","The rural expansion program has progressed well, with around 60% of the rollout completed. The revenue per site has slightly exceeded expectations, and the cost per site is lower than initially anticipated. The success of the program can be attributed to innovative solutions such as solar power, improved batteries, and reduced diesel usage. The response to the new sites in rural areas has been strong, with traction seen across the country. The rollout is expected to be concluded by around November or December.","['Let me start with rural. As you know we identified 60,000 high potential Villages for expanding our network to win a fair share of 4G net additions. This expansion continues to be in line, and is delivering as per expectation, in fact it is delivering modestly ahead of expectations both on the revenue per site as well as lower on the operating cost per site, and the reason is that it is really driven by digital tools and data science to plan the network in a precise optimal manner.

 'Let me switch to a quick update on each of our segments. In the mobile business we added 5.6 million 4G net ads. Postpaid, this quarter saw a significant acceleration and contributed almost 26% of the overall net ads for the quarter coming in at 833k net ads. The ARPU got to Rs 200 versus Rs 193 in quarter four. This as you know is the first goal post we set for ourselves a few years ago. We are now looking at getting to the next goal post, which is a longer-term goal post of the target of Rs 300 ARPU. The movement in ARPU we have seen reflects the power of our premiumization approach that I have talked about earlier. What is driving this premiumization, feature phone to smartphones gives us an upgrade or feature phone to smartphone gives us an ARPU upside. The 5.6 million 4G net ads is a clear ARPU upside there. Prepaid to postpaid is one area where ARPU pretty much doubles. The third area is data consumption and monetization. This is really driven through a very, very strong mix of contextual targeting,'

"Just continuing on that millimeter side, Reliance Jio has said that they are looking at 4G slicing as a tool which is allowed in the SA, and they want to deploy FWA and they want to accelerate their growth in the fixed broadband and considering that we are on a non-standalone, will that limit our capability to that per year?","Non-standalone technology allows slicing, even though standalone may be needed for multiple slices in the future. The current network capacity is underutilized, so slicing in a non-standalone network is feasible. The focus is on providing a seamless experience across the city and transitioning investments from 4G to 5G, rather than being limited by the non-standalone status.","['Sanjesh Jain - ICICI Securities\n\nThanks Gopal.

 'No, firstly let me disabuse you of that notion. I think there are two parts to the question, one is FWA itself and the other is slicing. I think non-standalone also allows you to do slicing, the 3GPP standards are clear about this. There have been experiments that we have already carried out, it does allow you to do slicing. So if those applications you need 15 different slices at some point in time, yes, you need standalone, but that is nowhere near the horizon at best you will have one slice on FWA or two slices, these kind of slices are totally possible in a NSA network. Second remember the spectrum is unutilized it is a network that is empty so even if you slice it what is the value because it is an empty network so whether you give it, you give a small slice, or you give a whole slice it does not really matter. So I would say that, that is still perhaps in the distant future as the networks fill out that you need to slice and so on and so forth, but technically you can slice even on an NSA network.'
 'that they use on this little device that we carry in our pockets is really messaging or some video or some browsing, and as a consequence 4 to 6 Mbps is more than adequate and it is at a point of indifference beyond that. So if you get more than 4 Mbps you are at a point of indifference unless you are downloading a heavy file or downloading a heavy game or something like that so I think we are in the game fully and the way we look at the deployment is really to make sure that we are giving a seamless experience regardless of the technology a great data experience right across the city, a great voice experience right across the city, and continue to offload 4G capacity investments into 5G. So that we do not spend a single dollar on 4G anymore and all our investments are geared towards 5G. That is really how we approach this state.'

 'Yes, I think it is a good question, a big increase in ARPU can only happen with a reset of the tariff table, and as you know we are at the lowest levels of the world both in terms of rate per GB on data as well as average revenue per user on both. If you go to plot rate per GB of data on the X-axis and average revenue per use on the Y-axis, India will be at the bottom left-hand corner relative to all the other markets in the world including markets in South Asia or sub-Saharan Africa or anywhere in the world. So the big increases will really come from a tariff reset, but within the confines of the challenges that we operate with in a competitive market we have seven levers like I mentioned I think prepaid or feature phone to smartphone you get a ARPU upside, the entry level feature phone price plan is at Rs 155, the entry level smartphone pricing where you offer meaningful amounts of data is Rs 239. So you do see a almost a 50% jump as people move from a feature phone to a smartphone, and that is a function'
 'Aditya Suresh - Macquarie\n\nWell that is good it is a steady increases each quarter, as these levers play at the background rather than being step changes which generate headlines. That is clear. Thank you for that. The second question is on operating leverage. Now with your comments around your focus on network operating expenses and your comments now on APRU and that steady increase is going forward should we expect a higher state of incremental EBITDA margins over the next couple of years and maybe it is a supplement and then this ties back to your comment around three cash flows as well which I agree with any comments on what this means for your return on invested capital.

Mr. Jain you may please unmute your side introduce yourself and ask your question now.\n\nSanjesh Jain - ICICI Securities\n\nThanks Gopal for taking my question. First on the 5G side, one of your peer has said that they are through with the 65% of the rollout and it appears that in the first stage they will be doing 175000 towers. Where are we in comparison as far as the 5G rollout goes. That is number one and associated question is on each side when we deploy the 5G what is the kind of data capacity upgrade we do.\n\nGopal Vittal - Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer, Bharti Airtel Limited'
 'So for the same block or spectrum whatever is the capacity of 4G, 5G would have a capacity which is roughly between 4 to 5 times. Let me try and explain this in a different way Sanjesh. On average we have about 50 to 60 megahertz of spectrum across the country deployed on 4G, and the petabytes that we have on our network. You also know that we are still not a congested network, we still have headroom from further capacity even on a 4G network. So let us assume that the capacity utilization is 60%-65% which means that based on the petabytes that we are pumping out you can see what is the upside on that same tranche of 50 to 60 megahertz. Here you have got a 100 megahertz spectrum. So number one is a double of the spectrum, so you can straight away double that, number two is it is more spectrally efficient. So you get another 50% to 60% increase in that. So therefore I think that there is a long runway for 5G to start filling up. It is a empty network and it will remain so for some time to come.'
 'Like I mentioned Kunal we are seeing about 30% of offload, so in a site where there is both 4G and 5G depending on the devices, and depending on what the traffic is, we see up to a 30% offload of this traffic from 4G networks to 5G networks. It is still early days because the overall installed base is still low it is 14%-15% it is not grown at the rate that we were expecting it to grow. Even today 5G shipments are only about 48% of the total shipments. So it is still moving slowly and it will take time for the full upgradation to happen. The way I think about monetization as I mentioned is at an aggregate ARPU level. So for us the monetization levers is feature phone to smartphone, prepaid to postpaid, data monetization, and finally of course if there is a tariff increase, and that gives you a monetization as well. The capex that we are putting in is largely on 5G we are not putting any 4G capacity capex other than the rollout of rural sites, which is really a coverage related capex. So the way we look at'

 ""Varun Berry: No, you're right. See, the pricing, we had -- in fact, we had kept taking price increases even till the end of Q4, right?

And you're right about -- see, last year's price increases continue till the end of the year. But the max number of price increases that we took is worth till Q3, right? So yes, next, we are cycling a pretty high base as far as these quarters are concerned. So we will have to make sure that we work doubly hard to get our top lines to grow.""
 ""Being the market leaders, also, we had taken the first mover advantage on all price increases because we wanted to make sure that all inflation was covered. So there were lots of corrections which had to be made because in certain cases, some large competitors had taken pricing downsides.

We've also increased our advertising and sales promotion to support our brands and drive innovation. We've obviously doubled down on our cost efficiency programs across all functions to make sure that we remain extremely competitive, and we remain the lowest cost operators in our categories.""

No. So I think it's our target that we've taken. We've had a good quarter, this quarter 1. So it gives us some confidence that, we can take up that target of delivering 23% for the year. And you have to bear in mind that, seasonality of each quarter as well. So that also plays a role. So we've had a good quarter. But overall, we target to 23%.\n\nTushar Manudhane: Understood.

 'The US business reported the highest ever revenue, driven by traction in differentiated portfolio with revenue of USD222 million, growing at 43% Y-o-Y. South Africa grew at 13% Y-o-Y in local currency terms, powered by a solid performance in private market, including OTC.\n\nAmidst geopolitical and currency headwinds, the focus of international markets has been on margin expansion, which has aided our quarter one performance. Our free cash flow generation and operating efficiency continues to drive our healthy net cash position.\n\nOur EBITDA margin stood at 23.6% for the quarter on a reported basis. As always, this EBITDA margin is not including other income. Our EBITDA margins for the quarter include impact of higher R&D expenses and other provisions. R&D investments are driven by ongoing clinical trials on differentiated portfolio as well as other developmental efforts higher in the quarter by 27% versus last year.'

You've articulated that whatever the stake that\nyou have right now is not going to 9.9 anytime soon. But given how RBL financials are, it\nprobably will need capital infusion like 1 to 1.5 years down the line, which is sooner than the\ntimeline. So, is there a thought process that you will participate in that? Because right now\nyou've just, bought from the open market, so how should we think about that.\n\nAnish Shah:    Haven't thought about that but I would just say that we expect the bank to do well. There will\nbe multiple folks who want to come in on a rights issue and at that point we'll be, look, do we\nparticipate in a rights issue to maintain 3.53 or do we not participate, I think it'll depend on\nthat, but that's frankly going to be a very small amount.

back to our investors. So, we will look at how we give it back in the best form if we have to.
Right now, we're waiting for our EV plans to get completely finalized to make sure we've got
enough buffers for that and if we have to then start giving back we will do it at that point in
time. We are in a significant growth mode at this point, which is why we haven't done more
than that so far. But despite that, I'd say close to a 40% increase in dividend is a pretty good
start in that front.",Mahindra & Mahindra.pdf

And why do we have a stock of 30 days at dealerships?\n\nRajesh Jejurikar: Yeah, there's typically a conversion time, right. So, basically there's a time to convert billing to retail because at the end of the day, a customer who was waiting for the vehicle when the vehicle is going to come has to arrange their cash, has to do their loan closure and has to pick a time and date which suits them for when they want their delivery.

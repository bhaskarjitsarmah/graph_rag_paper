Now, if I try and impute from that, the cost of term deposits, it seems to indicate that, from the bottom of first quarter last year, it seems to be up about 200 basis points. So is that rough number correct? And does that mean that, there is not much incremental re-pricing that is to happen on the term deposit book? That's my first question."", ""And with this backdrop, I am happy to say that we at Kotak Mahindra Bank continue to strive and grow and we are feeling pretty confident about how things are shaping. And while my colleagues will take you through a number of developments, there are two important developments which stand out for me to share with you.\n\nThe first is a very significant lever in terms of our deposits growth. Our deposits have really picked up and are growing at a very good pace, driven by a product which we think is, again, bold and disruptive in this marketplace, which we call as ‘ActivMoney’. And this product for us, just in this quarter, has grown at a flat rate of 24%, which would make it annualize nearly 100% growth on an annualized basis.\n\nAnd it's a unique product which is now about 7% to 8% of our total funds or total deposits and it positions itself beautifully from the point of view of cost of funds\n\nPage 4 of 22\n---\n# Kotak Mahindra Bank Limited\n\nJuly 22, 2023"", 'Uday Kotak: I wanted to add something here. This is Uday here. If you go back to 2011, when savings deposit rates were opened up, most of the strong entrenched incumbents did not change their rate. We went out and started a 6% savings deposit rate and sustained it with the higher pressure from 2011 to 2020. We were perceived as the potential disruptor.\n\nIn this period, we grew our savings franchise for a period of over nine years at 40% plus compounded CAGR. We believe that, we are looking at total cost of funds. We believe that, we have a strong position in the CASA, which we are quite confident, we will maintain at a reasonably high level versus the broad industry benchmark. So we are not worried about that in terms of absolute CASA percentages.']","Yes. So lot of the term deposits, which are taken earlier, durations are not long. So a lot
of them have got priced in, in terms of the renewals. And as we go forward, some more
will get priced in, but assuming the rates stay as they are, then maybe after a quarter or
so, I guess most of that would have happened.",Kotak Mahindra Bank.pdf
"So your attrition rate has gone up quite sharply over the last two years.
What's causing this and how it's impacting your operations?","The attrition rate has increased significantly over the last two years, with the highest rate seen in junior management roles, particularly in sales, service, call centers, and collections. This increase can be attributed to various factors such as employees reevaluating their career choices post-COVID, industry-wide demand-supply imbalances, and the inclusion of probationary officers in the attrition calculation. To address this, the company is implementing initiatives focused on improving working conditions, enhancing engagement, providing better training, benchmarking, and leveraging technology for automation to mitigate the impact on operations.","[""Pankaj Agarwal: Yes, hello, sir. So your attrition rate has gone up quite sharply over the last two years. What's causing this and how it's impacting your operations?\n\nShanti Ekambaram: Yes, I'll take that question. Shanti here. So if you see the breakup of the attrition, and I just want to quote some numbers, at the senior management level, it's around 10%, at the middle management level, it's less than 20%. It's only in the junior management, which is really at about 50%, which is what our disclosure is. And this is largely in sales, service and call center, some amount in collections. Now this has had several reasons.\n\nFirstly, this was the first full year post COVID, where people have decided their calls as far as their careers are concerned and we have had some spillover of attrition this year. At the industry level, there is a strong demand supply gap, which continues. Despite that, we were able to fully resource our requirements despite the gap and the attrition."", ""We are focusing on a number of areas to reduce the attrition. Sorry, another point. We also include probationary officers in the calculation, which is not really permanent employees, but we include them in the calculation for the purpose of attrition. A lot of them are reflecting only in the junior management.\n\nWorking on a number of platforms and areas, including how to make ease of working, better engagement, training, benchmarking, and technology automation and how to make their lives easier. So a number of initiatives are being worked on to see how we can control the attrition. So far, it's not really impacted in terms of our business. You can see that, but it's important that we work on this.\n\nPankaj Agarwal: Okay, one related question. Is it the reason that cost, employee cost is going up for all the banks? And can it put a structural pressure on cost to assets ratio for the banking?"", ""The technology cost has got elevated and it will possibly remain there for a while.

Another question, perhaps on the operating expenses. So any color on, how we see this shaping up over the next couple of years, because we've actually seen the cost to assets increase quite substantially over the last couple of years. So, when do we see this start moderating? And that's it from me and congratulations on the quarter. Thanks.\n\nJaimin Bhatt: So on the cost, as I explained this quarter, we've had on the employee front, the delta looks higher because of the retiral cost. If I take that out, the employee cost delta between last year and this year is about just over 20%. This is including the increments and all which, we would have done at the beginning of the year. On the overall cost and again the other things are we have been spending this quarter on promotion particularly on the ActivMoney promotions.""]","So if you see the breakup of the attrition, and I

" Is it the reason that cost, employee cost is going up for all
the banks? ","Employee costs are increasing for banks, which is in line with industry trends. This rise in costs is not solely due to employee expenses but also includes factors like technology costs.","[""Pankaj Agarwal: Okay, one related question.

"can you talk about the divergence in margin performance versus the mix? So, we had lower share ofexports and higher share of Hunter, but still margins have improved quite substantially. What has driven this margin on a YoY or QoQ basis?","The improvement in margins can be attributed to various factors such as cost efficiencies, pricing strategies, product mix optimization, operational improvements, or other strategic initiatives that have positively impacted the company's profitability.",['# EICHER\n\nEICHER          ICICI Securitics\n---\n\n\n---\n\n\n---\n\n\n---\n\n\n---\n\n\n---\n\n\n---\n\n\n---\n\n\n---\n\n\n---\n\n\n---\n\n\n---'],"
So basically, margins have gone up about 1.5%, which is the impact of price hikes that we had taken on May 1, that is flowing through the margin. Apart from that, about 0.8% is on account of the savings in sourcing costs, which we talked about last quarter as well. And of course, the international mix is therefore weighing down, so that's essentially making up the overall growth in margin.",Eicher Motors.pdf

"If you can just help us understand how are we doing on the whole non-vehicle ambit, which is basically our accessories or spare parts revenue, all of that?","You are inquiring about the performance of the non-vehicle segment, particularly regarding accessories or spare parts revenue.",['# EICHER\n\nEICHER          ICICI Securitics\n---\n\n\n---\n\n\n---\n\n\n---\n\n\n---\n\n\n---\n\n\n---\n\n\n---\n\n\n---\n\n\n---\n\n\n---\n\n\n---'],"In this quarter, it has almost about 25% growth compared to last year, and it has been growing very well. Our accessories, we are adding SKUs more. Our accessories actually for the existing motorcycles, anyway it is during the consumer journey, it goes through the MiY page. And then he can configure that against styling, safety, comfort, that's what the vertical which we give it in the motorcycle accessories. But also for the motorcycles which were sold about three years back, all the old motorcycles for that also we brought in a configurator where the consumer can actually build the motorcycle accessories even in his motorcycle. And to order that that is also enabled and that is also working. At our service area also, we are opening. Spare parts, we are looking at more than in a revenue stream, which is very good incidentally, we look at it from a consumer satisfaction angle, Pramod, because we always look at even the last washer, it should be available at any point of time at any place when it is required.",Eicher Motors.pdf

So, I think we don't necessarily talk about our cost outlook per se. But I think in the first quarter, we have taken about a 1.5% price increase in certain models, the impact of which will flow into the second quarter.",Eicher Motors.pdf
"When can we expect the next motorcycle like Bullet 350 and all, because the media reports that it is supposed to be in August end or something. So, can you give some sense on the near-term launches?

"irstly, on exports, you guys talked about the macro weakness that's impacted the volumes. 1\vo-part question essentially, how we should then think of the full-year FY24 outlook for exports. And beyond the near-term also, if! have to think about exports, I mean where does the growth come from? Is it market share? Is it category expansion? How should I think about it?","The full-year FY24 outlook for exports may be influenced by factors such as macroeconomic conditions, global demand, and any potential changes in trade policies. When considering exports beyond the near-term, growth could potentially come from a combination of factors including market share gains, expansion into new categories or markets, and strategic partnerships or collaborations.",['# EICHER\n\nEICHER          ICICI Securitics\n---\n\n\n---\n\n\n---\n\n\n---\n\n\n---\n\n\n---\n\n\n---\n\n\n---\n\n\n---\n\n\n---\n\n\n---\n\n\n---'],"Market share, it's a derivative Gunjan to be honest, because we normally don't look at only the market share. But in a market which is already existing, and our brand is getting accepted more and more, I can't give you a direct answer of where exactly the numbers ofinternational markets will be. But I will tell you where the brand love is. I think I mentioned to you also that we were looking at a rider community in Europe. It's almost about some 17,000, 18,000 people signed up for it. So that's the product love, which is coming up and the brand love coming in. And we have, mind you, we have only about 1,000 retail outlets as of now outside India and there is a huge potential, which is there for us to grow. But we are not doing just like that, because we have to take the macro conditions of the particular market now. We have to be careful about not loading the dealers. So, we wanted to do it in a systematic form, so that the ecosystem is also profitable. So, we are slowly opening up, and there are enough prospects which are cleared up for all the markets. So, the reach is going to be one major lever for the international markets in time to come. And all the new products which are going to come one after the other, because Royal Enfield nowadays are making only the global products. It is not country-specific like earlier times. All those products also will create their own category in that market.",Eicher Motors.pdf
"Great scale up that we've seen in the last one year. And I mean, I remember maybe the last conference call or prior when you had mentioned that there's a lot more opportunity for Hunter to still scale up, given that the volumes are now at 16k-17k units a month. Do you still see there are some gaps where this model can scale up from the current run rate to say, 20k-25k. I mean I'm not trying to get a number, but directionally trying to understand the potential ofthis model from where it is right now? Or you think it's matured?","The potential for further scale up of the model is still present, with room for growth from the current volume levels to potentially reach higher figures.",['# EICHER\n\nEICHER          ICICI Securitics\n---\n\n\n---\n\n\n---\n\n\n---\n\n\n---\n\n\n---\n\n\n---\n\n\n---\n\n\n---\n\n\n---\n\n\n---\n\n\n---'],"Look, I think for a product, one can't send it has come to the maturity level, Gunjan. Obviously, I'm not going to give you the number exactly as you said. But I'll tell you directionally. Hunter, what is this product, once again, to give a clarity to everyone is that people love the Royal Enfield brand. They wanted a product which is a bit more different and agile, and it should be nimble, and he can relate to the product. And compared to the other products it can be slightly at a lower weight. That's where we thought that we should bring it to the younger audience. And what we wanted from that product exactly is what it landed into the hands ofconsumers. And that's why I mentioned when the metros started taking young guys, now the rural areas are also now started taking on the Hunter. International market, not that the Hunter is available in all the markets, even in a few markets, we are just opening up. So, the Hunter as a franchise overall is growing for Royal Enfield. We see there's a huge potential for the Hunter in time to come.",Eicher Motors.pdf
he sale ofabove 250cc motorcycles has increased to 8% of industry versus 2%-3% 10 years ago. How would the share increase over the medium to long-term?

It is from 50,000 at one point of time to almost a million motorcycles. That's the growth over the decade. From here where do we see it, our understanding is that there are enough disruptions, which are taking place. But especially ICE vehicles in the premium segment, it is going to continue to grow. In that growth, the overall volume will grow and because we have enough new products, which are coming in and our own activities which we are doing and working with the community, we'll also see our numbers going up",Eicher Motors.pdf

Directly, we are going to do that, signing up the dealers. So that's also a transition which is taking place. In all those markets, as ofnow, the market is not growing. It is slightly opening up, that's where it is. But the good thing which is happening is as the retails are better. Our market share, we are marginally gaining or holding on to the market share. So, we are not losing out on anything. In my understanding, some of the markets will open up in another about five, six months' time. That's where I see it will open up. It's only once again, readings and personal understanding of this. There's no signs to say that this country will open up by this particular point of time. So, we will only be looking at consciously loading into those markets. But we have a lot ofnew products which are going to come and that new products are going to get us new consumer eyeballs into those. And that's how we are seeing, there is a huge growth potential which is possible for us. We have almost 1,000 retail outlets outside India. We are focusing on increasing those retail outlets in all the markets, but we will not rush ourselves. We will go systematically, because we always look at it, it has to be credible over a period oftime that shouldbe a pull brand.",Eicher Motors.pdf
"See, the waiting times on all your models range from one month to six months. What is the cause for that? Are we rurming overcapacity? Or how do you see it? Is there a shortage ofparts?",The waiting times on all models ranging from one month to six months could be due to high demand for the vehicles.

What happens is every product when we come out with a business case, vis-a-vis what is the market acceptance and numbers, all our products have positively surprised us in a way. So, we have put something as a capacity, and then we started looking at it. The market response has been very good. So, there is a lead time, which is required to come back and then give that extra need, which is there in the market. So that's the capital which we have to keep putting it in product-after-product. Most of our products are as of now, about three, four weeks times and barring a few products for which also we have already started the action. So that will take care ofthe supply situation for those products.",Eicher Motors.pdf

As advised, as on 30th June, the fresh slippages were to the tune of 7,659 crores, and out of this, the pullback of more than 1,500 crores has already happened as on 31st July, which is amounting to about 20%.

Fair enough. Thank you.', ""Here also, I would like to mention that first quarter is very unique in its character. In the first quarter, one we don't have the advantage of the carry forward of the recoveries of the previous quarter and second, in the last quarter of any financial year, there are invariably various one offs. So, to that extent, that also inflate the performance in the last quarter of any financial year. So that's why we are comparing our performance on the YoY basis in the first quarter. So, I thought I'll just put across the viewpoint which we have in this context. Most of the core profitability metrics have also improved sequentially. Net interest income for quarter one financial year 24 increased by 24.71% YoY, on the back of the improvement in yields and continuing credit offtake. Domestic NIM at 3.47% has also improved by 24 basis points YoY. Non-interest income has increased by 421.73% mainly due to the MTM right back as well as gains booked in derivative income.

Well, what you mentioned in terms of you should compare pe credit growp on a sequential as compared to a year on year. You know, when it comes to pe economy, why pere's a busy season and pe lean season? There are certain reasons because our economy has got certain characteristics. So, likewise, I still stick to my argument, pat first quarter, we should compare only on a quarter-on-quarter basis, not on a quarter-on-quarter but on a year-on-year basis.

And, the intention is that we intend to take care of our depositors’ interest also. It is not merely a commercial consideration. We are a bank which is almost more than 217 years of existence. So, we have to nurture our customers and we have to be mindful of our relationship with them. So, that is the reason why, in some of the buckets we increased, which actually addressed our commercial requirements also, ALM requirements as well. But, not universally, because we are very mindful that overall how much impact it will bring in in terms of the cost.\n\nMr. Hardik Shah – Goldman Sachs:\n\nOkay. And sir, my second question is on home loans, particularly, we have lost market share. Our YoY growth is lower than the industry growth. So, what are your thoughts on that?']","International, we are very cautious. One, of course, because of the scenario in the global economies. And, one of the other reasons is, when we look at our international book, the India linked loans which are seen lower, is essentially on account of the fact that we had some... some oil companies had these revolving lines. So, they have not availed and that is one of the reasons. But, we are very very mindful in terms of the quality of risk. If at all I may say so, we go for cherry picking in our international book, which is not like our domestic book. And, there we operate absolutely like a corporate bank. And, asset and liability both are priced... they are linked to the variable rates. So, we have already seen the kind of movement in the FED rate, etc. So, SOFR and SONIA all are getting influenced by that, and that is one of the reasons why we see the kind of NIMs which we are seeing. But I would say that, over a period of time it will get normalised also, it will not remain at this level for the rest of the year.",State Bank of India.pdf

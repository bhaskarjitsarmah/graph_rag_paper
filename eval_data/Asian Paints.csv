"I was just trying to push the bubble by saying that given one does not have a material one time, what we saw almost about 23% margin, that logically one does not see any risk to that continuing and hence there could be possibly an upside risk to your guidance?","The margin position is still healthy even without the one-offs, and the overall margin numbers are influenced by how raw material prices pan out in the market. The company's commitment to maintaining a certain band of PBDIT margins is evident, and they do not base decisions solely on quarter-to-quarter margins due to external factors like inflation impacting the margins in the past. The company remains focused on growth through strategic marketing initiatives and aims for a steady growth rate of about 25-30% each year, emphasizing a balanced approach to expansion without straining the system.","['Avi Mehta (Macquarie):\nI was just trying to push the bubble by saying that given one does not have a material one time, what we saw almost about 23% margin, that logically one does not see any risk to that continuing and hence there could be possibly an upside risk to your guidance?\n\nAmit Syngle:\nYou are right as it depends also in terms of if we really look at some changes with respect to pricing in other areas, then possibly it would, come down and might not remain in this level.

And secondly, the overall margin numbers are also closely governed by how raw material prices pan out in the market. You have seen that during the whole period of inflation, when the inflation levels had gone to about 20-25-30% levels, despite taking price increases, the PBDIT margins had gone almost to about 15-16% levels.

"And in general, how long does it take for the dealer to generate the requisite ROI?","In general, it takes about 1-2 years for the dealer to generate the requisite ROI.","['Sheela Rathi (Morgan Stanley):\nMy first question was with respect to the distribution, the dealer network, which we have added this quarter about 6,000 dealer points and this year we have guided to about 10,000-15,000 dealer points. Just wanted to understand we are looking to get more into smaller cities.

And in general, how long does it take for the dealer to generate the requisite ROI? And has there been any change in terms of the timing on generating the ROI; because, companies like yours and other competition are also talking about being more aggressive with respect to adding the dealer points.', ""Amit Syngle: What we see is that today the opportunities obviously in terms of the dealer and retail points is that we keep on looking at not only the smaller towns which are coming up, but we are also looking at a lot of suburbs of the bigger cities, which are expanding. So, it's a combination of looking at retail points coming at both these points. What we also feel is that today, it's a journey in terms of how the retailers start. They might do a certain amount of business in a year and they kind of keep on growing progressively over the next 3-5 years and therefore the drop out of a dealer, from the point of view of year one dealing with us to kind of going to year three, year four is not very high because we look at putting in a tinting mechanism, which gives them the flexibility of earning more money given the fact that the retailer is able to cater to a larger range of SKUs which he can offer to the customer."", 'In our experience, what we feel is that this is a kind of journey which will continue given the vastness of our country and given the opportunities of now the larger road network, government infrastructure, the way it is developing. I think the opportunities are fairly huge. For example, if you look at the entire J&K portion today and the opportunities that have opened are very big. Similarly, look at North East, given the connectivity of roads which is coming. So, I think these areas of expansion are going to continue and we feel that right from year one onwards, people get their ROI because at Asian Paints, we offer them a very, very high rotation of inventory and they keep on growing as the years go by. Some 5% of the retail network might drop out because of some liquidity crunch or some other personal problems which might come in.

"My first question is we have seen the Kitchen and Bath business kind of struggle to scale up immensely. If you could take us through the journey, what have been the challenges?

"What do you think in our case, how the price cuts will be implemented and how would the channel react to those price cuts?","Price cuts would be implemented cautiously, considering factors like raw material prices and currency exchange rates.

The channel's reaction to price cuts would likely be monitored closely to ensure that it does not significantly impact primary sales due to inventory adjustments.","['Overall, as we go ahead, depending on how the raw material prices pan out, how the rupee dollar parity pans out, we might look at even pricing corrections.

Second year again, we would have grown at about 30-35%. Last year we grew almost about 10-15%. So last year was a bit slow and this year in the first quarter, we are seeing to some extent the business slowing down because of the large base.\n\nSo, I would not say that the business has not grown. I think last three years, the combined business of the two entities is close to about Rs. 830 crores. Therefore, this business has grown from about Rs. 500 crores to about Rs. 830 crores, and I think that's a good increase, which we have seen in the last three years."", 'Large focus on efficiency; to improve profitability of business\n\n| |Kitchen Business|Bath Business|\n|---|---|---|\n|Breakeven at PBDIT level| | |\n|~growth of 28% over last year| | |\n|De-E Last year 01 nad high base cue I0 price increases| |Q1FY24|\n|Launched new website & app. to enhance brand| | |\n\nWe already have a Kitchen and Bath business which has been there. The Kitchen business has been doing well. We experienced a growth in the FKD business, but the components business was slow. We had a high price increase base last year and therefore from that point of view, we had a 12% de-growth in terms of our revenue. As far as the PBT is concerned, we improved our margins in the Kitchen business, and we were at about a minus Rs. 2 crores, kind of an overall PBT. As far as Bath is concerned, again Bath was affected by a strong price increase base, and we almost have a breakeven here against a Rs. 4 crores profit which we had last year.']","Happiness is a relative state of mind.

"If you look at the Q1 margins, they were pretty strong vs. of a guided range of 18-20%. So, what do you think is the best utilization of margin from here? ","The best utilization of margin from here would likely involve a combination of strategies such as channel discounting, reinvestment in 'Above the line' and 'Below the line' programs, marketing activities to enhance market share, and various schemes and discounting mechanisms to stimulate market excitement and growth. This approach aligns with the company's commitment to growth and aggressive stance towards maintaining and enhancing market presence.","['# Amit Rustagi (UBS):\n\nI have a question relating to margins. If you look at the Q1 margins, they were pretty strong vs. of a guided range of 18-20%. So, what do you think is the best utilization of margin from here? Would it be more channel discounting or reinvestment? Or you think the price cuts? So, what do you think is the status quo. What do you like to achieve from the excess margins you have?\n---\n# Amit Syngle:', ""We don't really act on quarter to quarter in terms of the margins you get, because you have seen the last two years, given the inflation, I think the margins had gone even lower than that band.

We would obviously be aggressive with respect to our ‘Above the line’ and ‘Below the line’ programs. In terms of what we do in marketing and our share of voice in the market, our media spends and our other marketing activities, including, various measures on really exciting the market through various schemes and discounting mechanisms.

We have seen deflation in Q4 FY23 and we have seen deflation of about 2% in the current Q1 of FY24. We see that the overall gross margins have gone up to about 43.4%. And this has been also aided by a lot of work which we have been doing with respect to the formulation and sourcing efficiencies.

I think if you take out the one-offs, the margin position is still healthy. So, I don't think the one-offs are really influencing the numbers in a strong manner. And secondly, the overall margin numbers are also closely governed by how raw material prices pan out in the market. You have seen that during the whole period of inflation, when the inflation levels had gone to about 20-25-30% levels, despite taking price increases, the PBDIT margins had gone almost to about 15-16% levels.

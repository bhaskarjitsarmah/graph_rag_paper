So, we do expect price correction to be lower in Q4. So overall, we do believe that based on what we are seeing and our assessment of Q2 as well as of H2, we feel comfortable with the guidance of revenue growth of 1% to 5%. And you're absolutely right.

So, I would say, generally, even though we did take some returns in Brazil, for the most part, the return levels are quite low. Instead of taking returns, we did more renegotiation with channel.

We worked with the channel and renegotiated some of the positions and also then anticipated some future sales with them.

This was primarily on account of lower payables and a reduction in factoring, as I spoke earlier. In rupee terms, the factoring was down by INR 1,700 crores versus last year. Overall, we expect to end the year with working capital of 65 to 70 days. To give you an update on the corporate realignment initiative, during the quarter, we transferred our Specialty Chemicals business to a wholly owned subsidiary, UPL Specialty Chemicals Limited. This proposed transfer has been approved at the shareholders' meeting in July, and the transaction is expected to be completed in the next few months.""]","So, it certainly will get reversed in Q4 as I said, Q4 is when most of our cash collection happens. Also, as I mentioned earlier, about INR 8,000 crores of build-up was therein working capital. There have been certain investments and the tax and other payments too.",UPL.pdf
And how do you see sort of evolution and basically time given by the rating agency to sort of get back to a full sustainable sort of business?,"The rating agencies have been monitoring the market conditions and have taken into account the reduction in non-recourse factoring by $250 million in Q1. These actions are likely to be viewed positively by the rating agencies, and discussions with them are scheduled in the coming weeks.","[""We do expect to continue with this trend as we move into the next two, three quarters. Clearly, looking at the state of business and the market, largely, as Mike alluded, looking at the conditions of market, we will take all measures to improve our cash cash flows and see how we can bring down the debt further.\n\nAbhiram Iyer: Got it. Got it. And in a sort of similar vein, the company's bonds are still sort of on negative outlook by Fitch, one of the two agencies which rated investment grade. Maybe just give a bit glimpse on what the conversations have been? And how do you see sort of evolution and basically time given by the rating agency to sort of get back to a full sustainable sort of business? I mean, currently obviously, there is an impact from market effects."", ""Anand Vora: Yes, I think the good part is –that the rating agencies have been rating various other crop protection chemical companies, and they do know the market conditions. In Q4, they maintained their rating. As more and more information started making available on China as well as some of the other companies came up with their results, they understood the market conditions.\n\nAnd also, most rating agencies take into consideration the non-recourse factoring and we have reduced the non-recourse factoring by $250 million in Q1, that is something which I'm sure they the rating agencies will look at more positively. But we are yet to engage with them after the results. So those calls are scheduled over the next couple of weeks."", ""Madhav Marda: Got it. And the second question was a lot of the AIs that you said, and we've seen data on pricing having come down meaningfully in the last six or eight months. Are these prices -- would you call that a sustainable level or do you think these are prices where it's -- where profitability comes under question because there's been a lot of volatility inside of a lot of products over the last say, since COVID to now. Do you think current prices are more sustainable or are they like below sustainable levels? How would you read that?"", ""S. Ramesh: So, if I may squeeze in one more thought. In terms of the cash flows, you have seen it reduce substantially to about INR 268 crores. So based on your guidance, what is the kind of visibility on cash flows? And how do you see that impacting your rating going forward by the end of the year?\n\nAnand Vora: As I mentioned earlier, Ramesh, that the rating agencies have a good view on the overall industry, and they are also rating some of our peer group companies. So, it should not come as any surprise to them. So, the reduction in absolute debt by about $160 million as well as in terms of non-recourse, that's off-balance sheet reduction of $250 million, I think should auger very well in our discussions with the rating agencies.\n\n# Page 13 of 16\n---\n# UPL Limited\n\nJuly 31, 2023\n\nS.

May I just understand that your revised EBITDA forecast includes this cost reduction or is this an upside that potentially might come about if these are on track?,The revised EBITDA forecast includes the cost reduction initiative of $100 million over the next two years.,"[""Abhiram Iyer: Perfect. And just one last question. There is a cost reduction initiative that's been mentioned of $100 million over the next two years and about 50% of them would be in the next fiscal year. May I just understand that your revised EBITDA forecast includes this cost reduction or is this an upside that potentially might come about if these are on track?\n\nPage 10 of 16\n---\n# UPL Limited\n\nJuly 31, 2023\n\nAnand Vora: We have included this cost reduction in our 3% to 7% EBITDA increase guidance.\n\nModerator: We have our next question from the line of Darshit Shah from Nirvana Capital.\n\nDarshit Shah: So, the India business has been fairly okay as far as Q1 was concerned, while the rest of the regions, as you mentioned, are seeing a sort of channel destocking and price fall. So, can you highlight what is the situation in India in terms of our product portfolio and overall general industry perspective on the Indian market?"", ""Anand Vora: Nitin, as you see Q1, we have managed to bring it down by about $160 million. I think as I mentioned earlier, our efforts will be to bring down our debt further. Considering the industry where it is today, I think it's best to focus on profitability and conserve cash. So, we will look at reducing the debt.\n\nI also mentioned that we are closely monitoring the capex spend. So, for everything that’s within our control, we'll try to see how we conserve cash. And needless to mention, we'll keep bringing down the debt as we move forward during this financial year.\n\nNitin Agarwal: And second, on the guidance given out, I think it's a pretty reasonably positive guidance for the full year in my view. What is the risk that you see to the new guidance number of 3% to 7% that you put out on the EBITDA?"", ""Michael Frank: Yes, Nitin. So, part of that goes back to how we're looking at overall our cost of doing business and so we really do think that on some of these AIs, specifically in the post-patent and herbicide market that these costs have reset. And therefore, we're also resetting our costs, both from a manufacturing and SG&A standpoint in those segments.\n\nAnd so, when we talk about taking cost out of the business in the range of $100 million over the next two years, it's really setting up our post-patent business to be leaner so that we can compete more aggressively. And so, I would say that's primarily how we're adjusting for this new reality.\n\nNitin Agarwal: And secondly on guidance from a year-end net debt perspective, do we have any color on what are we looking at in terms of reduction of debt versus the last year? So where do you see the dollar debt ending up?"", ""We do expect to continue with this trend as we move into the next two, three quarters.

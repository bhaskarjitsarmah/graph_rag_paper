"You and I-Pru have seen a good pickup in protection, so just wanted to ask how sustainable this pickup looks? What are the factors driving this now?","The sustainable pickup in protection is being primarily driven by customer demand, particularly seen in HDFC Life web search activities. Additionally, there is a strategic focus on activating frontline sales across different regions with a tailored approach to product offerings. The company is aiming to enhance its retail protection segment by introducing return of premium products in Tier 2/3 markets and emphasizing term products in larger markets. This growth strategy has enabled HDFC Life to consistently increase its market share over the years. The company's confidence in maintaining margins and expanding profitability is supported by the consistent product margins and the targeted growth trajectory they are pursuing.","[""Vibha Padalkar: Yes. I'll hand this over to Suresh.\n\nSuresh Badami: There are multiple elements because of which we are seeing an uptick in protection. First, we see customer demand, which we believe will be sustainable. We see this demand in HDFC Life web search, which is happening in terms of protection.\n\nClearly, we are seeing a customer led demand. The second piece is that we are now looking at higher activation of our frontline sales across all geographies in a very calibrated and product-centric approach. What we are trying to do is trying to see whether we can have return of premium products in the Tier 2/3 markets and whether we can have a better mix of term products in larger markets. Based on this, we have been trying to grow the overall retail protection."", ""If you look at Slide 6, you'll see that every year from FY19 to FY23, we have grown faster than the private and overall sector and our market share has expanded. We were 12.5% in FY19, and we've reached 16.5% in FY23. That is the philosophy of triangulating and not wanting to lose our position in terms of ranking.\n\nThat hopefully answers your question as to why can't it be 30%. I can easily be at 30%. It is this triangulation wherein we will grow brick by brick. The pause was only because of tax. This year, we will come out with similar margins to last year, and next year, we will continue to move upwards.\n\nModerator: The next question is from the line of Adarsh from CLSA.\n\nAdarsh: Vibha, Congrats.

That kind of meaningful growth that you're beginning to see is what I had alluded to in an earlier question.\n\nI want to stress that this is without doing anything adventurous on the underwriting guidelines or even on pricing. This is on a calibrated but focused basis. Of course, some of this is also, whatever we went through during COVID and then repricing in terms of price increases.

To your point on what gives us the confidence of margins expanding to last year levels by the end of the year. It's that the intrinsic product margins haven't really changed too much. The gap is in the growth that we aspire for, which is 15-17% number versus the 12% in Quarter 1. That is largely the differential in margin, which is something that we expect to even out as the year progresses.\n\nPrayesh Jain: Great. And on protection profitability - when you are getting into the lower tier towns, Tier 2/3, would you say that it would be on a relatively lower side as compared to what you would be doing in the metros and Tier 1?\n\nVibha Padalkar: No. It is priced for all the risks that I mentioned to an earlier question, whether it is for slightly worse mortality or persistency levels.

The reason we are in this business is more in terms of relationships and being in the market. By group savings, presumably you mean all the funds that we manage, group funds.|\n|Nischint Chawathe:|That is right.|', '# Prakash Kapadia:\n\nThank you. My questions have been answered.\n\n# Vibha Padalkar:\n\nThank you.\n\n# Moderator:\n\nThe next question is from the line of Prayesh Jain from Motilal Oswal.\n\n# Prayesh Jain:\n\nFirstly, on the non-par savings guaranteed return products. What has been the experience? While the share has definitely gone down, has the experience been better or worse than expected from what you would have thought when the tax changes were announced? And to\n\nPage 19 of 23\n---\n# Life\n\nHDFC Life Insurance Company Limited July 21, 2023\n\nextend that question, so when you say that the margins will improve in the second half, how much of the recovery in margins would you attribute to improvement in non-par business?']","Margins are fairly similar compared to what we've had in the past, adjusting for this gap in the growth that we spoke about earlier on the call. At very high-ticket sizes, of course, volume has been impacted to some extent as expected, but it's been more than made up by the growth in the other ticket sizes where at an overall level, the average ticket size has been maintained for the segment. As a consequence of that, margins are more or less where they were earlier. There are competitive pressures as you can expect in all categories, including this one. But, we've been maintaining our pricing discipline by and large, over the period since we launched this product category, and there could be maybe a lag of a month in terms of getting back to the pricing levels that you would like, but we've been fairly disciplined about that to be able to achieve this.",HDFC Life.pdf
"It's a known fact that our cost associated with HDFC Bank is relatively on the higher side. Now given the relationship changes between parent and child, then do we expect that the cost what we pay to HDFC Bank will still remain at those levels?","The cost associated with HDFC Bank may not necessarily remain at the same levels due to the evolving relationship dynamics between the parent and child entities. The adjustments in costs could be influenced by various factors such as the type of customers served, profit margins, persistency rates, and mortality experiences. Discussions between the entities are ongoing, and changes in cost structures may occur as the relationship continues to develop.","[""Sanketh Godha:\n\nGot it. And last one from my side. It's a known fact that our cost associated with HDFC Bank is relatively on the higher side. Now given the relationship changes between parent and child, then do we expect that the cost what we pay to HDFC Bank will still remain at those levels? Or it will broadly grow in line with the APE growth, that the channel will give us?\n\nVibha Padalkar:\n\nWe look at this as fully loaded cost. What the Bank has been able to give us is a very different category of customer. I think it is not quite right to say one particular distributor’s costs are more. It is what margin does one make out of it. What is the persistency. Expense is one aspect, but mortality experience at the same expense is different. So, all of those assumptions will impact what the margin is."", 'If I understand your question correctly, whether the Bank will take into consideration that we are now a subsidiary and leave something on the table? I think these kinds of conversations are more for the Bank. But when the Bank says parent and child, I think it subsumes many such big and small things, which will come out of these discussions, which are happening at a very regular basis.

Some of the players like PolicyBazaar are now moved from a web aggregator to a broking code. So they are reflected under the Broker channel.\n\nAdarsh: Got it. And my second question is, if you go back to the last call, what you have been saying is that because of the merger of the parent, the share you will end the year or you aspire to end the year at is 70% wallet share. This is a very big move from where we were last year. So obviously, you started moving in that direction this quarter, small changes in Q1, as you mentioned. What's the big change that will happen on ground for you? And do you see that playing out to up to 70%? Or it will be a little more gradual?\n\nSuresh Badami: I'll add on to what Vibha mentioned in the first answer to Suresh. We have seen a slight increase of 0.5% to 1% in terms of our market share increase at HDFC Bank. But to your point, I think it will be gradual because it is going to be calibrated both at the Bank level as well as at our level.""]","I think these kinds of conversations are more for the Bank.

Just wanted to check, Vibha that 70% still remains an aspiration by the year-end or on-ground implementation can be a little more spaced out?\n\nVibha Padalkar: Yes. The 70% is not a number that we are articulating. It's up to the Bank and how they see it. It's not even been a month since the final consummation of the merger. The Bank will be in a new avatar of a conglomerate as against just the Bank. As that organically starts seeping in, the leadership at the Bank have said how we can upsell many things to the customer.\n\nIt is a strategy that will be led by the Bank as the parent.

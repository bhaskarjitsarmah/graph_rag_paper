","The company has not implemented price changes uniformly across all products. Additionally, the current market conditions have been sluggish, affecting both rural and urban markets. Despite growth in modern trade and e-commerce, traditional trade markets have been slower.

So could you elaborate on what exactly you have done in terms of several pricing initiatives? And in case you have passed on gramage back to customer, when do you see the volume trajectory benefiting because of that?\n\nBecause if you have passed on grain, why is the volume still flattish? And related question to this is when I see the market share data which you have given? Number 2 the player has lost significant market share, but that benefit does not seem to have come to us.

Now as I was saying on the last slide, some of the companies had not covered as well as we did last year. So their commodity prices were much higher than ours last year. So they have seen a deflation, which is much larger than what we've seen this year. And as a result of that, there's been quite a few price corrections, which have happened in the market.""]","No. So the way to think about it, the way I think about it is that the priority for us, we are reasonably profitable. I think we are -- our margins are very robust and healthy. The trick is growing our top line and making sure that we get the volumes and the shares which are required,
and with that will come the margins.",Britannia Industries.pdf

Yes. So against last year, INR550-odd crores, we should be targeting double-digit strong double-digit growth. That's what you're saying?\n\nVarun Berry: Yes.\n\nShirish Pardeshi: Okay. And my second question on UP and Tamil Nadu. You mentioned that there are some incentives which we have got. So what is the quantum, which we have already booked in this quarter or maybe this year expected to come? And part 2 is that what it means to -- and you said both the locations, we have started 5 lines. So could you explain what are these lines you have started?\n\nVarun Berry: So on the incentives, UP, we have still not got the eligibility certificate, so nothing, therefore, is recognized in the books.

First, would it be fair to say that 1Q reflects the entire impact of the rising price-based competition? And hence, we should retain our expectations of a flattish EBITDA margin for the full year.|\n|---|---|\n|Varun Berry:|Well, I would not say that it's not flattish. If you look at our trajectory for many years, except for -- so if you look at it, if you look at '21, '22, we were at an average of about 14%, right, on operating profits. In Q1, we are at 15.6%. So what you are really looking at in the coin periods of high numbers. So whether it's 2021, and obviously, last year, we were taking price increases to make sure that we met our targets as far as inflation was concerned. So if you were to look at -- if you were to draw a line progression line, I think we are moving in the right direction, and I think that will continue.|"", ""Varun Berry: So in this quarter, we've taken price reversals of about 1.8%. There were fiscal benefits, which were one-time PLI accrual, which was taken in Q4 last year, which was 2.4%. So price reversals of 1.8%, fiscal benefits are because they were taken in Q4 and not in Q1. So that's 2.4%. There's an employee cost increase, which is flattish. And there is a decrease in other expenses, which is led by advertising spend, which is about 1.2%. So versus Q4, we are negative by 3.3%. So that is the number that you're looking for, I believe.""]","So we are in the process of -- yes.

"So you mentioned you probably need to take some more price corrections. And our understanding is there is a bit of a sequential up move we are seeing in edible oil, sugar, and possibly even in wheat flour. So in this environment, do you not feel that there could be more pressure in margins in the near term? ","There is no significant uptick in edible oil prices, and sugar inflation is being monitored closely by the government. While there has been some inflation in sugar and flour, the company believes it is covered for the next few months. The approach is to carefully manage any potential risks that may arise and make adjustments as needed to mitigate them quickly.","['Moderator: Next question is from the line of Arnab Mitra from Goldman Sachs.\n\nArnab Mitra: My first question was, again, actually, on margins. So you mentioned you probably need to take some more price corrections. And our understanding is there is a bit of a sequential up move we are seeing in edible oil, sugar, and possibly even in wheat flour. So in this environment, do you not feel that there could be more pressure in margins in the near term? Or are there other ways you could offset this situation?', ""Varun Berry: No. So see, edible oil, there is no uptick. Edible oils actually are at the lowest ever in the last 3, 4 years. Sugar, yes, there has been a little bit of inflation, but I think the government is very clear that they want to control this. So I don't think there's going to be much inflation as far as sugar is concerned. Flour is the one which we really have to watch because the production hasn't been as good this year. And while the inflation currently is low single digits, but we've got to watch that. But at this point in time, it seems we are covered for the next 3 or 4 months.\n\nSo we just have to make sure that we do this carefully. And obviously, we are doing things in a way that they are reversible at short notice. So we don't see a risk. But if there is a risk that emerges, we will be able to make sure that we mitigate that very quickly."", ""Percy Panthaki: Okay. So how do we look at margins for the rest of the year? Should we believe that unless the commodity prices change versus the current levels, the margins that you have currently sort of done are a good representative of what should continue in the future? Or do you think that it could drop further because you might take further price cuts? I mean how should I approach this? I'm not looking for a number guidance, but more of guidance on how to think about this?\n\nVarun Berry: No. So the way to think about it, the way I think about it is that the priority for us, we are reasonably profitable. I think we are -- our margins are very robust and healthy. The trick is growing our top line and making sure that we get the volumes and the shares which are required, and with that will come the margins.

Am I reading that right?"", ""August 07, 2023\n\nLook at it versus last year, there's been an inflation of about 3%. Now these are numbers for us. Obviously, the numbers because we were covered last year, our inflation or last year's numbers for us were much better than the industry. So other companies probably have seen a flattish story as far as CAGR is concerned.\n\nPalm oil has been a huge deflation. We've seen a deflation of almost 21%. On sugar, there has been a slight inflation of 1% and versus last quarter, it's been an inflation of 2%. On laminates, again, there's been a deflation versus last year of 18% and versus last quarter of 3%, and similarly on corrugated boxes.

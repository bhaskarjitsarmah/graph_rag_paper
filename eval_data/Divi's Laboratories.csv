Please go ahead.\n\nShyam Srinivasan: Just on the split of generic and custom that was shared, so when I just add the generic piece and the nutraceuticals together and look at growth on Y-o-Y basis, it seems to be still subdued, like low single digit, like flattish kind of a Y-o-Y trend, even if I look at it compared to the quarter before also, it seems to have declined. So, just want to understand and also reflect upon our guidance for fiscal 24 when we exclude Molnupiravir we are looking at double digit growth, so if you can help us understand that, sir?']","We cannot differentiate because we don't have blocks built for custom synthesis and buildings built for generics. We have buildings dedicated to type of chemistry like chlorination, hydrogenation, so different products go into different buildings for different stages of chemistry, but a product like Molnupiravir or Raltegravir where we have built production buildings as per the requirement of the customer; that is different, but usually that is not the case.",Divi's Laboratories.pdf

It includes my expansion capex, modernization, routine capex, WHRS capex order and fuel and everything.\n\nShravan Shah:  Okay. Okay. And sir, when you say we are looking at double digit volume growth. So is it fair to say that it should be mid-teen kind of number that one can look at?\n\nAtul Daga:     I will comment not on that.

As for 155 million ton, how much power is required? About 1,200 megawatts of power will be required. So 720 megawatts will be green energy. That way highly remunerative.

Just a couple of things. So, first, in terms of the WHRS so currently 232 and we say 425 by FY '26, so by FY '24 or by FY '25, if you can help us how much more we will be adding...\n\nAtul Daga:     We will have By FY '24, we'll reach 300 and I think between '25 and '26, the remaining obviously.\n\nShravan Shah:  Okay.

Or we are still speaking to whatever strategy we have in terms of booking...\n\nAtul Daga:     No, we are also dynamic. I have increased my inventories. March quarter, we were at the end of March quarter, at 38 days of stock. Today, we are at 58 days of because as I mentioned, if you have heard me about China, I still feel China might start importing.

Is it just because of availability or on landed basis, coal is now cheaper than pet coke for us?\n\nAtul Daga: Availability. So on landed basis pet coke is far cheaper in energy terms, which is quite unusual it is more about the availability of pet coke.\n\nIndrajit: And what would have been our alternate fuel usage in this quarter?\n\nAtul Daga: Not sure how much. 5%.\n\nIndrajit: And how do you see that progressing?\n\nAtul Daga: So yes, we have taken a target to grow up to 9% to 10% by the end of next fiscal year. Lot of investment was required, which we have taken up in this financial year, close to INR250 crores. Yes, close to INR250 crores of investment is happening in this financial year for shredders and clearing systems, handling systems for alternative fuel. And accordingly, we are tying up also for alternative fuel.', ""Atul Daga: Yes. So 115, if it's a price, you mark it up for moisture losses. So consumption will be USD125 to USD130.\n\nAmit Murarka: Okay. Understood. And what would it mean directionally for your power and fuel cost, let's say, either in rupees Kcal terms or as a percentage?\n\nAtul Daga: 2.34 was our Kcal cost this quarter.\n\nAmit Murarka: Okay. And assuming like pet coke of 115, like should it go down to like 1.7, 1.8, like 115 would be I guess 1.8?\n\nAtul Daga: It is downward. I haven't done the math because the mix will also have a play here.\n\nK.C. Jhanwar: I would like to add, here,. See the availability of pet coke is also not too high because 115 to 125 happened within a weeks -- 10 days time. And as you all know, the availability of the pet coke is very limited, actually, and it's coming maybe a part of the pet coke is coming from U.S. So again, there is a cycle of about 60 to 65 days.

I only had one primary question to ask that to see reduce on a lead distance? Could there be a saving which could have been reflected this quarter, Second is we do have a benefit in terms of the clinker conversion because I've seen your presentation to something like 1.44. So while I was expecting that the fuel mix will impact the reduction of the cost will actually be reflected in this quarter.\n\nBut apparently, it's not to the extent that were expected even at the price has gone by INR100 per ton, the impact of the fuel reduction would have offset the reduction in the prices. So and second quarter, obviously, you are saying that we will see improvement in the EBIDTA per ton. So what all factors will actually contribute in the improvement of EBITDA per ton?"", ""|Atul Daga:|Things are looking more positive. That's the most important element. I think, Navin, my colleague clarified it's generally incentives, which have started kicking in the other operating income that you were asking.|\n|---|---|\n|Navin Sahadeo:|Sure. So from an annualized -- so let's say from a quarterly run rate INR200 crores of run rate going ahead?|\n|Atul Daga:|Should be possible according to this.|\n|Navin Sahadeo:|Sure. And just one last bit, if I may repeat. You said pricing, of course, in current environment with demand being strong is, of course, looking good and it should pick up coming quarters. But next year, which is like after the elections next year, typically demand may get a little soft like it happened in FY'20 that FY'19 saw a 13% plus kind of a growth, but 20% was just flat. So that happens even in that scenario, would you be confident on pricing? Or it's too far to talk about?|"", ""Your last question is I remember was about what will be the drivers for profitability improvement.

See, the green energy projects are coming up by FY '25. The big projects, which we spoke about on this call will come up by June '25. That is where it will reflect second quarter, I would not want to comment because its rain. Third quarter, you will see the benefit of improvement in prices followed by fuel price gain.

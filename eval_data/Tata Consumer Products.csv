So wanted to understand here lot of the growth will be coming because of so much of diversification also and initially of course the pipeline filling is there for the new products. So you're saying the core business is also doing quite well, right?","Yes, the growth in Soulfull has been significant, with a doubling of revenue last year and over 50% growth this year. The expansion into new products and diversification has contributed to this growth. Additionally, the core business of Soulfull, particularly in the breakfast cereals segment, is performing well, which is essential for driving overall growth.","[""# Abneesh Roy\n\nRight. Just one small follow-up there. You grew 2x last year and this year also 50% growth in Soulfull. So wanted to understand here lot of the growth will be coming because of so much of diversification also and initially of course the pipeline filling is there for the new products. So you're saying the core business is also doing quite well, right? Because the mid to high single-digit market share, that seems to be a bit lower versus the kind of expansion you have done?\n\n# Sunil D’Souza\n\nSo absolutely, Abneesh. I mean just like our overall business, our core has to do very well and then the expansions have to fire, right? So the whole equity of Soulfull has been built on breakfast cereals and we are moving out from there. Just like the TCPL algorithm is built on decent volume, strong categories, market share growth in tea and salt and that is helping us drive the rest of the portfolio.\n\n# Abneesh Roy"", 'In the consolidated, you have International business which grew 3% including acquisitions and also you have the growth of NourishCo and Soulfull, which also grew by over 50% each. The nonbranded business had a good quarter, grew by 5% driven largely by price increases. Margin, we see an increase of 19% compared to a revenue growth of 12%. Again an improvement driven by both the price increases we have taken in different parts of the business compared to the same period in the previous year and also strong cost initiatives and restructuring especially in the International business.', ""# Abneesh Roy\n\nSure. My second question is on Growth business. So extremely impressive performance so now it's 20% of the India business. My question was when I see your broader gross margin and EBITDA margin profile, it's around 43% gross margin, EBITDA margin 15%. But when I see your market share for example in Soulfull say high single digit, it is not a market share which can make lot of money at the EBITDA front. So wanted to understand here how you're seeing this entire 20% of the India portfolio in terms of profitability metrics. Is there a good movement or still because new products are getting launched, at an overall this 20% level the EBITDA margins, etcetera, may not have had a significant improvement versus say 3 years back?\n\nPage 7 of 18\n---\n# Sunil D’Souza:"", 'Page 6 of 18\n---\n# Sunil D’Souza\n\nJust to give you the investment thesis in Soulfull; strong brand, good products, strong team; needed to be fueled with distribution and marketing dollars. I think that thesis has borne out. Last year Soulfull doubled in revenue and again this quarter we have had north of I think 50%, 55% growth. So very strong growth. In terms of market share itself, significant improvements from where we started, but I would say we’re in the mid to high single-digit range right now in overall cereals category.\n\nMasala oats actually, we have crossed I think, I would say, strong double-digit market share especially in places where we are present. So I would measure say modern trade, we are at a very, very decent double-digit market share number. In specific geographies where traditional trade has executed, again very, very strong market share numbers.']","So absolutely, Abneesh.

"Is there a good movement or still because new products are getting launched, at an overall this 20% level the EBITDA margins, etcetera, may not have had a significant improvement versus say 3 years back?","There has been a good movement in terms of profitability metrics for the 20% of the India portfolio. The company has seen an improvement in EBITDA margin and overall profitability, with a focus on optimizing fixed costs and other expenses. Additionally, the company has introduced new products and made structural interventions that have led to sequential improvements in margins over the past three quarters.","[""# Abneesh Roy\n\nSure.

We are seeing revenue up by 12% in the stand-alone accounts, an improvement in EBITDA margin from 14.8% to 15.4% and PAT up by 23%. In the consolidated results, we've seen a 12% growth in revenue and an improvement in EBITDA margin by 0.8%. And if you look at the SEBI results, you'll see though material cost is marginally higher, we've optimized fixed costs and other expenses. So we're seeing a slightly improved gross margin as well as an overall improvement in EBITDA percentage.\n\nMoving on to PAT, INR359 crores versus INR277 crores, an increase of 30%. Group net profit after share of JV and associates lower at 22%. There is a loss compared to a flat number in the same period previous year because of a loss in the North India plantation arising out of weather conditions, lower crop and an element of lower realization as well. So that's the overall performance."", ""Sunil D’Souza: So effectively when I say innovation to sales, we take products which have been launched in the last 3 years. Again when I say product, changing of packaging, new graphics, new brand architecture, etcetera, doesn't qualify. It has to be distinctly new products per se or products which have been tweaked substantially. That's the number. When I do a benchmark with Indian food and beverage companies overall, about 4% to 5% puts us in the top quartile and that's why we had set a long-term target -- medium to long-term target of hitting 5%. It's good that we hit 5% in the first quarter. I would say I'm just keeping my fingers crossed that we continue at this level going forward."", ""As we have said, we expect to see mid to high single-digit volume growth and a couple of points on price mix. We're still not there yet. Salt business, just to remind everyone, we took a 33% price increase in about 15 months. Despite that, we've seen a 5% volume growth which is good. But going forward given the fact that there is not going to be too much pricing, I think growth is going to be driven by volumes and premiumization.\n\nGrowth businesses have been delivering well up to 20% of our portfolio now. I think the standout is NourishCo, which has continued performing despite adverse weather conditions. Starbucks: Tata Starbucks recorded a strong quarter and now 348 stores. In the International business, pricing actions and structural interventions have led to sequential improvements in margin for 3 quarters now.""]","So Abneesh, just as a perspective. The way we measure -- and there's a reason they’re called growth businesses because we do think they've got a long runway. Just as a perspective today my business is highly tea and salt in India and we moved from almost single digit to about 20% right now. Just as a perspective, that 20% is also dependent on seasonality because NourishCo remember fires very well in summer and that's one of the reasons why it has hit 20% from 15% where it was same quarter last year.
But you're absolutely right, the margin profile on some of the Growth businesses is not where it needs to be. That said, it will improve with scale and as we fine-tune our entire offering there. What we do measure is a) growth rate; b) the fact that the growth rate is getting fueled by the right amount of A&P and distribution; and lastly, the contributory margin has to continue to improve because essentially the thesis is that these are; for example Soulfull, Sampann; these are riding on my base logistics and S&D platforms and there is not incremental fixed cost that we are incurring out there. So as long as the contribution margin moves in the right direction, I am adding incrementality to the business.",Tata Consumer Products.pdf
"We have seen in some of the other categories where sharp deflation has happened, for example coconut hair oil or say detergent, there is a level of pipeline -- the inventory destocking because trade is expecting more of the price cuts. In salt, is there a price cut which you have taken and would you see that there will be a requirement of price cuts there? ","There are no price cuts anticipated for salt at the moment due to the overall flat cost environment. The company has not seen significant cost movements that would necessitate price reductions. Additionally, the recent stability in dollar prices and a slight decrease in coal costs have contributed to the expectation of maintaining current pricing levels.","['# Abneesh Roy:\n\nSir, last, very quick question. We have seen in some of the other categories where sharp deflation has happened, for example coconut hair oil or say detergent, there is a level of pipeline -- the inventory destocking because trade is expecting more of the price cuts. In salt, is there a price cut which you have taken and would you see that there will be a requirement of price cuts there? Because you are still saying that the price hike will not happen, but you have not spoken on the price cut. And second, of course will be on the market share loss at the lower end, would you be worried because in tea we have seen earlier and we have also seen wherever sharp price hike happened and then deflation happened, regional players are coming back.\n\n# Sunil D’Souza:', ""# Sunil D’Souza:\n\nSo Abneesh, the good and bad news is last year when everyone was facing inflation especially for businesses which were exposed to palm oil, crude, wheat or sunflower; we were not. In fact our tea prices were on a reverse trend. And therefore, we did not have as much of a price uplift in our portfolio. Right now what we are seeing is broadly flat to slightly marginal downtrend on tea. I would say right now we are braced for a flattish versus last year's sort of number, maybe slightly below, but that depends on how weather plays out especially in the north.\n\nOn salt itself, we would have expected the total cost to come down a bit because it's made up of 2 things: a, is imported coal, therefore coal, imported coal and the dollar prices and it is brine, which is sourced locally. Now dollar is stable, coal has come down a bit; but the catch is brine has seen a little bit of uptick given the recent cyclone which has happened in Gujarat."", ""So broadly it is flattish, all these numbers put together. So we are not seeing cost movements and therefore we do not see price cuts happening for now and the reason I'm emphasizing for now is because tea prices we had thought will come down. We had not expected this heat wave in the north in April and May, which held up the tea prices. But if all things remain constant, tea we would start to see it coming down, which we have not till now, okay?\n\nAnd therefore, broadly we are playing in a flat cost environment and therefore no price cut anticipated. On the salt question itself, I wouldn't be too worried simply because I know I've\n\nPage 8 of 18\n---\n# Tata Consumer Products Limited\n\nJuly 27, 2023\n\ntaken a 33% price increase. The local players, which play even at a lower quality, there might have been a bit of swing. But I do think I have the ability to recover it very quickly once prices stabilize, which is what we are seeing now."", 'Sunil D’Souza: So the good news is that we had very clearly focused on building a strong procurement engine for ourselves on the non-tea commodity so to speak. And over the last about 12 months, I think we have started to get a few things right whether it is the upcycle or the downcycle which is happening in these commodities. And therefore, I see no reason to worry about. As commodity prices go up so will we take up prices and when they go down, we will also correct it. Overall margins, again the way we measure gross margins, contribution margins; they have gone up for Sampann overall and we are spending money behind brand building for Sampann which we had not for the past few years. So we do expect volume and revenue growth to happen.']","So Abneesh, the good and bad news is last year when everyone was facing inflation especially for businesses which were exposed to palm oil, crude, wheat or sunflower; we were not.

And the second part was within the geographies you are present, what would be your like distribution versus, let's say, the market's distribution of water or other beverages?"", 'Moderator: Next question is from the line of Sumant Kumar from Motilal Oswal.\n\nPage 11 of 18\n---\n# Tata Consumer Products Limited\n\nJuly 27, 2023\n\nSumant Kumar: Sir, can you talk about the region-wise penetration of NourishCo, where we are lagging, where we are going to have a more expansion in which region? And also how is the profitability scenario in next couple of years considering we are going to have a scale? As per my understanding, currently we have a higher single-digit margin in NourishCo. So when we can reach a double-digit margin?']","So we're in about 80% of the country right now. We are still not present in large swathes of geography and large urban cities for example, right? We are still yet to build up distribution completely in Bombay, in Bangalore or Delhi. I mean we are picking and choosing where we want to play where we can get the fastest dime for the buck if I may speak so. But you're absolutely right. We still got a long way to go on distribution. But I would say in the near to medium term, we will complete the distribution gap and then it will be a game of 2 things: a, is building out strength in the outlets per se and expanding portfolio. On both these things, we've got a healthy pipeline lined up and therefore, we remain confident of continuing to deliver strong numbers in NourishCo.",Tata Consumer Products.pdf
"A couple of questions from my side. Sir, if we see both the top players in tea segment have delivered or indicated low single-digit growth versus category growth that you have shared of 7.9%. So are the regional players making a strong comeback?",The performance of the top players in the tea segment has shown low single-digit growth compared to the overall category growth of 7.9%. This raises the question of whether regional players are making a strong comeback.,"['Moderator: The next question is from the line of Tejash Shah from Avendus Spark.\n\nTejash Shah: A couple of questions from my side.

Remain cautiously optimistic. While rural has started to come back, while the north has started to come back; I'm keeping my fingers crossed because 2 reasons. A, is still not pre-COVID trends and it's dependent on what happens with the whole monsoon/El Nino effects. Global inflation has started to plateau. I think we are more or less done with pricing or little bit -- small bits here and there on pricing left to tackle. But category demand trends in our key international markets especially on the volume front are going to be key monitorables. Q1 '24 we delivered in line with our commitment, double-digit top line with EBITDA margin expansion. Interventions we put in our tea business have started yielding results, but overall growth is still below our medium-term aspirations."", ""Moderator: Mr. Shah, is your question answered?\n\nTejash Shah: Sir, so second question pertains to NourishCo and then you have always maintained that you prefer to solve growth and profit problem statement together and not separately. Now the kind of growth that we're seeing here, how should we think about margin trajectory in medium term and at what scale, let's assume 2x or 3x from here, margins will start converging with the company level margins?"", ""Page 13 of 18\n---\n# Tata Consumer Products Limited\n\nJuly 27, 2023\n\nBetter than last year, but unfortunately in Assam, the heat wave I think played a bit of a spoiler and therefore while prices have moved down, they have not moved down as quickly. Now if the trend continues, we do see a little bit of margin expansion happening on tea. But again I would take it probably not one month, one quarter at a time when moving this. Broadly tea margins have come back to the ballpark, but they're still not where they should be. I think there is a little bit of opportunity out there, but I would take it one quarter at a time.\n\nModerator: The next question is from the line of Arnab Mitra from Goldman Sachs.""]","
That said, just as a perspective, I think even in our report we have disclosed saying that Tata Agni, which plays at the bottom of our portfolio, has started to see strong growth. So in any business, I think walking the balance between margin and market share is a critical piece knowing when to trade off for what. If all things come together, then it's the magic of margin increasing and market share increasing. But quite a lot of the times, you've got to decide what you're going to trade off. But over the longer term, I would say you should see market share inching up continuously.",Tata Consumer Products.pdf
"So my understanding is that Bisleri, which is the largest player in this field, makes EBITDA margin somewhere in the low to mid-teens. They have their own manufacturing also. We don't. So if we are paying conversion charges, our margins would probably settle around that 10%, 11% kind of mark. What is wrong in my thought process here?","Not all of Bisleri's manufacturing is owned by them; they operate through franchisees and independent distributors. Additionally, the company in question is not solely Tata Copper+, but also Tata Gluco+ and other products with higher margins. Therefore, the assumption that margins would settle around 10% to 11% due to paying conversion charges may not be accurate.","[""Moderator: The next question is from the line of Percy Panthaki from IIFL.\n\nPercy Panthaki: Again I also want to ask on NourishCo.

My second question is on Growth business. So extremely impressive performance so now it's 20% of the India business. My question was when I see your broader gross margin and EBITDA margin profile, it's around 43% gross margin, EBITDA margin 15%. But when I see your market share for example in Soulfull say high single digit, it is not a market share which can make lot of money at the EBITDA front. So wanted to understand here how you're seeing this entire 20% of the India portfolio in terms of profitability metrics. Is there a good movement or still because new products are getting launched, at an overall this 20% level the EBITDA margins, etcetera, may not have had a significant improvement versus say 3 years back?\n\nPage 7 of 18\n---\n# Sunil D’Souza:"", 'Page 12 of 18\n---\n# Tata Consumer Products Limited\n\nJuly 27, 2023\n\nmargins per se.

So International business, 25% and 26%. Underlying trend of improved EBITDA in the International business mainly driven by cost. In the International business, however, I should mention that volumes have been soft and there has been an element of small share loss in the coffee business, but we expect that we will come back and overall market growth will improve in the coming quarters.\n\nSo that's it from my side.

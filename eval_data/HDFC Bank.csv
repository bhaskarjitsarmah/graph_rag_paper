"So somehow I feel on an incremental basis for the quarter, you might have lost a lot amount of market share, anything specific which affected this quarter's deposit mobilization?","The slowdown in deposit mobilization during the quarter is primarily attributed to the typical sluggishness experienced in the first quarter. This period is historically known to have lower growth rates compared to other quarters. Despite this, there is still underlying demand present, and there are positive signs of traction in mortgage logins post-merger, indicating potential growth in loan disbursals.","['And two, I know that if I take you back a quarter or two ago, that it is not about one quarter, you should look at how extraordinarily it got built in March, and then we sustained it. That means we did not lose that over and then we built on top of that because it was not a small feat and at least INR50,000 crores came through in March quarter, more than what one would have envisaged and we kept that and we built on top of that. And particularly the retail, if you see, we built 38,000 in retail. Typically the first quarter, you see the current account going down and savings account to some extent moderates due to spend.', ""Abhishek: Got it. The second question, Srini, is on deposits. Now the reason or the point I'm trying to get to is your incremental deposit market share requirement is roughly 25%. And if I look at a longer period acquisition rate, you're going at 20% incremental market share. So there's still a 5% gap. Now, incrementally, would you have to raise rates? Because you've kept your rates at or below competition mostly. But now you have this incremental requirement, right? And it can't just be fulfilled through your investments in branches? So how do you think about your rates on the TD side versus let's say, or going forward, and will that lead to stickier rates on your cost of funds and therefore some more pressure on NIM? How do you think about that?"", ""Moderator: Thank you very much. We will now begin the question-and-answer-session. The first question is from the line of Suresh Ganapathy from Macquarie. Please go ahead.\n\nSuresh Ganapathy: Yes, hi. I have two questions, Srini. One is on credit growth and deposit growth. The other is on merged company profitability.

But I'm looking at the system number. Apparently the system seems to have added INR9 trillion of deposits of 5% Q-o-Q.

First quarter is typically a very slow quarter. If you look at three, five years' time period at an aggregate level on loans too, little more than mid-single digit to somewhere little, mid to low double digit, that's the kind of first quarter contribution to the full year. So it is normally slow, but we still see a good amount of underlying demand, which is there. And even as we speak, you didn't ask about this, but as we speak now as this quarter has begun and moving on, the mortgages now post-merger, what we get anecdotally from various sources within our bank, and as we see some of the logins, it has to translate into full loan disbursals.\n\nThe mortgage logins are 20% on a combined basis, 20% more than what we have seen before.

Typically Q1 is of all the quarters is a slow quarter. Across various parameters, it's a slow quarter.

We are in addition to organically building, we are in the market for all of those all the time.\n\n# Rahul Jain:\n\nGot it. Srini, just one last question if I can squeeze-in on the merger related costs. I mean, is there going to be any one-off that we should expect, any qualitative color that you can give around, as you move to consolidate the numbers between you and HDFC Limited for the second quarter or whatever, during the year? Anything that we should be aware of?\n\n# Srinivasan Vaidyanathan:"", ""Then the second thing is that from a pricing point of view, if there is some better pricing and there is a demand there, it gives you certain pick-up in the spread on that. So these are a couple of concerns, and then liquidity, of course. You get some cash and you can deploy it. You can, essentially it's leveraged again. You got the money, you can get more loans that you want, and you're able to leverage further. So that's the kind of thought process we deployed to do this.\n\nPranav: Perfect, thanks, Srinivas, that's very helpful.\n\nSrinivasan Vaidyanathan: Thank you.\n\nModerator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we have come to an end of the time allotted for the call. I would now like to hand the conference over to Mr. Vaidyanathan for closing comments. Over to you, sir.""]","No, there will be integration cost in the form of stamp duties and in the form of certain other costs that we will have. But they are, as we said, within reason, nothing substantial, but within reason it will be. We will call that out separately after we complete it.",HDFC Bank.pdf
"So this quarter, quarter-on-quarter, your interest costs are up quite sharply, 15%. So can you help us understand where you are in terms of your term deposit rates on balance sheet versus incremental?","The interest costs have increased by 15% this quarter. The bank mentioned that their time deposit pricing is closely aligned with peer benchmarks and they do not lead by price when it comes to attracting deposits. They have indicated a growth in time deposit penetration from 14% to 14.5%, but with more customers, the impact has been marginal. The bank's approach to pricing deposits is not solely based on leading by rates, as mentioned during the ALCO discussion.","[""Abhishek: Got it. The second question, Srini, is on deposits. Now the reason or the point I'm trying to get to is your incremental deposit market share requirement is roughly 25%. And if I look at a longer period acquisition rate, you're going at 20% incremental market share. So there's still a 5% gap. Now, incrementally, would you have to raise rates? Because you've kept your rates at or below competition mostly. But now you have this incremental requirement, right? And it can't just be fulfilled through your investments in branches? So how do you think about your rates on the TD side versus let's say, or going forward, and will that lead to stickier rates on your cost of funds and therefore some more pressure on NIM? How do you think about that?"", ""Srinivasan Vaidyanathan: Thank you.\n\nModerator: Thank you. We have the next question from the line of Saurabh Kumar from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\n\nSaurabh Kumar: Hi, good evening, Srini. Just two questions. One is on deposit re-pricing. So this quarter, quarter-on-quarter, your interest costs are up quite sharply, 15%. So can you help us understand where you are in terms of your term deposit rates on balance sheet versus incremental?\n\nAnd the second is -- basically on this, on the HDFC mortgage book. So fair to assume that in six months, this book completely moves out, moves into EBLR? These are two ones, thank you.\n\nSrinivasan Vaidyanathan: So second question I didn't understand. Mortgage book, what is this?\n\nSaurabh Kumar: This will all be repo-linked now. This is all EBLR-linked and HDFC Limited."", ""Page 16 of 19\n---\n# HDFC Bank Limited\n\nJuly 17, 2023\n\nAnd one of the ways in which we have recently got a change in balances of the deposit from customers is time deposit. We have seen that our penetration has been low at 14%. We moved that needle to 14.5% right now, but the denominator has also changed. We have more customers now. So while we have grown 29% last year, 26% in the recent quarter, still it has made a difference of only 50 basis points higher from a penetration. We have a long way to go.\n\nAnd if you look at the pricing, which is where you started this question, how far pricing is influenced by this, you can be any point in time, if you look at the pricing, our deposit, time deposit pricing was some of the peer benchmarks. If you see, they're pretty closely aligned. We don't lead by price. I want to leave the thought there. This is part of the ALCO discussion in terms of how we engage with the customer and how pricing is not the lead consideration for getting any deposits."", ""Mahruk Adajania: Got it. And my next question is on loan growth and incremental deposit growth. So just in terms of loan growth, we had kind of indicated doubling of the book. Do we see that starting FY ‘24? Because the run rate is a bit softer in the first quarter. So the merge balance sheet has grown 13% after including everything and if you exclude IBPC then it's grown 16%. So do we -- can we see a 17%, 18% growth as we end the year? Would that be a fair estimate?""]","yes, if you look at the deposit pricing over a period of time, the SA deposits haven't moved, as you know, not just for us, in the entire market it is what it is. It is the time deposit. ",HDFC Bank.pdf
Are you able to still quantify the crystallized liabilities of HDFC Limited at the time of the merger?,"Yes, the liabilities that get crystallized amount to INR6,36,000 crores, which includes the deposits and is moved along with the assets.","[""Manish Shukla: Good evening and thank you for the opportunity. Firstly, Srini, are you able to still quantify the crystallized liabilities of HDFC Limited at the time of the merger?\n\nSrinivasan Vaidyanathan: Yes, the liabilities that get crystallized about INR6,36,000 crores is what is moved to the bank, that INR6,36,000 includes the deposits, which is on page 23 of the earnings deck that we showed. That includes the deposit, but INR6,36,000 crores is what is moved along with the assets.\n\nManish Shukla: Sure, that's helpful. Secondly, on the merged basis, the loan to deposit ratio is at about 109%. How and when do you think you can break it down to the 100%? Basically I'm saying that in terms of the incremental funding requirements, how do you think, you bring deposits?\n\nModerator: Sir, sorry to interrupt, but the line for you is not very clear. I request you to please use the handset while you're speaking."", ""Abhishek: Got it. Thanks. And just squeezing-in one quick question on your calculation actually, so the ROA that you show in your PPT, that's 2.1%, is that calculated on quarterly average balances? Because when I calculated it comes to 1.9, so just trying to reconcile that difference?\n\nSrinivasan Vaidyanathan: No, I don't know how you calculate daily averages, but whatever they are, but you cannot get 1.9. You send your numerator and denominator we will tell you where there is an issue.\n\nAbhishek: Okay. I'll take it offline.\n\nSrinivasan Vaidyanathan: Yes, please.\n\nModerator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Manish Shukla from Axis Capital. Please go ahead.\n\nManish Shukla: Good evening and thank you for the opportunity. Firstly, Srini, are you able to still quantify the crystallized liabilities of HDFC Limited at the time of the merger?"", ""Mahruk Adajania: Okay, got it. And sir, what would be the, would you be able to quantify the CRR and SLR of Limited, HDFC limited at the end of June? Would that be possible?\n\nSrinivasan Vaidyanathan: No, see the, it starts to kick-in, I think in the next fortnight, it would start to kick-in. And we provided you the high level in terms of how we're carrying liquidity to both, to support the growth and support all the results that are required. The bank standalone LCR is 126% on a combined basis, which was 116% last quarter, 126% now, on a combined basis, Pro-forma combined, a little more than 120% after accounting for what is required for CRR and so on. So yes, quite comfortable with the position there to meet the regulatory requirements.\n\nMahruk Adajania: Okay. Thank you so much.\n\nModerator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Kunal Shah from Citi. Please go ahead."", ""Moderator: Thank you very much. We will now begin the question-and-answer-session. The first question is from the line of Suresh Ganapathy from Macquarie. Please go ahead.\n\nSuresh Ganapathy: Yes, hi. I have two questions, Srini. One is on credit growth and deposit growth. The other is on merged company profitability. So, let me first touch the deposit growth aspect. So, I know quarterly there can be fluctuations, but your Q-o-Q standalone deposit growth was about\n\nPage 6 of 19\n---\nHDFC Bank Limited\n\nJuly 17, 2023\n\nINR30,000 crores, 1.6%. But I'm looking at the system number. Apparently the system seems to have added INR9 trillion of deposits of 5% Q-o-Q. So somehow I feel on an incremental basis for the quarter, you might have lost a lot amount of market share, anything specific which affected this quarter's deposit mobilization?""]","Yes, the liabilities that get crystallized about INR6,36,000 crores is what is moved to the bank, that INR6,36,000 includes the deposits, which is on page 23 of the earnings deck that we showed.

One last question, I know it is the third one, I apologize for that. On the network opex one of the reason why our network opex on an overall basis is low that we are still not charging for the 5G cost whether it is a power cost or a rental cost is that the fair assumption and once those costs start showing up in a P&L what kind of…\n\nGopal Vittal - Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer, Bharti Airtel Limited\n\nNo, not the 5G cost.\n\nSoumen Ray - Chief Financial Officer, India & South Asia, Bharti Airtel Limited\n\nYes, so Sanjesh we have started as the rollout is happening progressively more and more circles will come and get charged out, the process has already started from this quarter, and because it is an NSA it is put on the same infrastructure the incremental costs are very low started already from this quarter.\n\nSanjesh Jain – ICICI Securities', 'Soumen Ray - Chief Financial Officer, India & South Asia, Bharti Airtel Limited\n\nYes, it would have been almost at same levels sequentially.\n\nVivekanand Subbaraman – Ambit Capital\n\nOkay great.

Gopal for a strong execution and follow through on your clearly articulated strategy. My first question actually is a fairly basic one. Now as you follow through on your premiumization path. I am keen to understand how you think about your ARPU trajectory going forward. Do you see it more like a steady compounding profile I appreciate you may not be able to get specific numbers, but any qualitative comments on the profile would be great.\n\nGopal Vittal - Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer, Bharti Airtel Limited', 'Let me turn to our financial performance. We delivered a strong competitive performance this quarter. Consolidated revenues grew\nby 4% sequentially to a shade under Rs 37500 Crores to Rs 37440 Crores precisely, powered by a strong India performance. India\nrevenues grew by 4.5% sequentially to Rs 26675 Crores, EBITDA margins are at 52.7%. This is an expansion of 0.5% from the last\nquarter, aided by the continued momentum on the war on waste program. Let me talk a little bit on this program. This quarter we\nreally focused on our network costs. Our network cost takeout program has been delivering a very strong outcome, network opex for\nIndia declined by 0.5%, despite our rollouts. So in effect for the first time in the history of the company, the operating cost per site,\nper month was actually lower than what it was in prior quarters, and this was done through a combination of identifying very high']","Yes, it would have been almost at same levels sequentially.",Bharti Airtel.pdf
First question is on how do you see the impact of Jio Bharat phone on the feature phone market?,"The impact of Jio Bharat phone on the feature phone market is being observed in the early stages. The feature phone market currently represents about 18% of overall revenues, with customers typically replacing their feature phones once every four years. While the pricing of the Jio Bharat phone is competitive, the focus for Bharti Airtel Limited is on encouraging feature phone users to upgrade to smartphones through bundling offers and cash backs. Bharti Airtel does not plan to launch a similar device as they believe their current 2G network and existing feature phones in the market cater to the needs of their feature phone users.","['Kunal Vora – BNP Paribas\n\nThanks for the opportunity. This is Kunal Vora from BNP Paribas. First question is on how do you see the impact of Jio Bharat phone on the feature phone market. Would you look at or you could use a similar device and like if you can share your experience with the devices in the past, like you had one with Karbon few years back.\n\nGopal Vittal - Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer, Bharti Airtel Limited', 'I would say that it is early days, I think that even when it was launched last time we did see an impact, at that point in time the feature phone market was much larger than what it is today.

The pricing of this device is slightly higher than the cheapest feature phones, it is competitive.

So that is really where our focus is.

So if you get more than 4 Mbps you are at a point of indifference unless you are downloading a heavy file or downloading a heavy game or something like that so I think we are in the game fully and the way we look at the deployment is really to make sure that we are giving a seamless experience regardless of the technology a great data experience right across the city, a great voice experience right across the city, and continue to offload 4G capacity investments into 5G. So that we do not spend a single dollar on 4G anymore and all our investments are geared towards 5G. That is really how we approach this state.']","Because largely these devices are only used for calling and we do not need to get into this device segment that is already there in the form of a feature phone.

"If you can share your thoughts on 5G monetization, and if you can provide any data on how many users, what kind of usage, what proportion of volumes are on the 5G network now?","5G monetization is seen as a significant opportunity for growth. The capacity of 5G is estimated to be roughly 4 to 5 times that of 4G, providing substantial upside potential. Currently, the 5G network is relatively empty with ample room for expansion. The focus on postpaid services is considered a key growth area, with only about 6% of users currently on postpaid plans. There is a belief that India will gradually shift towards postpaid services, presenting a high upside opportunity. Additionally, the transition of users from competitors to their network, especially early adopters seeking 5G, is viewed as a growth lever. Overall, the 5G network is expected to play a pivotal role in attracting users and driving monetization opportunities for the company.","['Like I mentioned Kunal we are seeing about 30% of offload, so in a site where there is both 4G and 5G depending on the devices, and depending on what the traffic is, we see up to a 30% offload of this traffic from 4G networks to 5G networks. It is still early days because the overall installed base is still low it is 14%-15% it is not grown at the rate that we were expecting it to grow. Even today 5G shipments are only about 48% of the total shipments. So it is still moving slowly and it will take time for the full upgradation to happen. The way I think about monetization as I mentioned is at an aggregate ARPU level. So for us the monetization levers is feature phone to smartphone, prepaid to postpaid, data monetization, and finally of course if there is a tariff increase, and that gives you a monetization as well. The capex that we are putting in is largely on 5G we are not putting any 4G capacity capex other than the rollout of rural sites, which is really a coverage related capex. So the way we look at', 'Kunal Vora - BNP Paribas\n\nSo why would you not do it, I mean, what do you see a reason to not go for a device like this.\n\nGopal Vittal - Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer, Bharti Airtel Limited\n\nBecause largely these devices are only used for calling and we do not need to get into this device segment that is already there in the form of a feature phone.

If you can share your thoughts on 5G monetization, and if you can provide any data on how many users, what kind of usage, what proportion of volumes are on the 5G network now.\n\nGopal Vittal - Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer, Bharti Airtel Limited', 'So for the same block or spectrum whatever is the capacity of 4G, 5G would have a capacity which is roughly between 4 to 5 times. Let me try and explain this in a different way Sanjesh. On average we have about 50 to 60 megahertz of spectrum across the country deployed on 4G, and the petabytes that we have on our network. You also know that we are still not a congested network, we still have headroom from further capacity even on a 4G network. So let us assume that the capacity utilization is 60%-65% which means that based on the petabytes that we are pumping out you can see what is the upside on that same tranche of 50 to 60 megahertz. Here you have got a 100 megahertz spectrum. So number one is a double of the spectrum, so you can straight away double that, number two is it is more spectrally efficient. So you get another 50% to 60% increase in that. So therefore I think that there is a long runway for 5G to start filling up. It is a empty network and it will remain so for some time to come.', 'As I already mentioned in my opening comments, I think postpaid we believe is a big opportunity. Today about 6% of our users are on postpaid. If I look at markets like Thailand that number is well past the teens, if I look at markets like Brazil it is almost 40% to 50%. So the upside opportunity in postpaid is clearly high, and I think India over a period of time will start moving more and more towards postpaid that has to happen. The levers of growth for us are number one of course is prepaid and postpaid that is one lever of growth where we see an increase in ARPU, the second lever of growth is switching a user from a competition to us and I think 5G tends to play a role where the early adopters of smartphones were looking for a 5G Network want to prefer us, so that there is an opportunity here because one of the player has not launched 5G, so that is clearly an opportunity, and the third opportunity is really around what we saw with Verizon almost over a decade ago, which is the great success that they']",It is still early days because the overall installed base is still low it is 14%-15% it is not grown at the rate that we were expecting it to grow.

"Second question is on your rural expansion program, can you give us a progress and how has been the response as you roll out new sites there?","The rural expansion program has progressed well, with around 60% of the rollout completed. The revenue per site has slightly exceeded expectations, and the cost per site is lower than initially anticipated. The success of the program can be attributed to innovative solutions such as solar power, improved batteries, and reduced diesel usage. The response to the new sites in rural areas has been strong, with traction seen across the country. The rollout is expected to be concluded by around November or December.","['Let me start with rural. As you know we identified 60,000 high potential Villages for expanding our network to win a fair share of 4G net additions. This expansion continues to be in line, and is delivering as per expectation, in fact it is delivering modestly ahead of expectations both on the revenue per site as well as lower on the operating cost per site, and the reason is that it is really driven by digital tools and data science to plan the network in a precise optimal manner. This coupled with our execution rigor is giving us results.\n\nLet me now turn to the top 150 cities, which is the second lens through which we look at the quality customer opportunity. In the top 150 cities more than 80% of the post-paid, broadband homes, and in fact 100% of the B2B opportunity is concentrated. Our focus is to win these cities by bringing the full power of the Airtel network, our channels and all powered using digital tools. For the top 150 cities let me provide more color around each of our segments.', 'Deepti - Moderator\n\nThe next question comes from Mr. Piyush Choudhary.

In the mobile business we added 5.6 million 4G net ads. Postpaid, this quarter saw a significant acceleration and contributed almost 26% of the overall net ads for the quarter coming in at 833k net ads. The ARPU got to Rs 200 versus Rs 193 in quarter four. This as you know is the first goal post we set for ourselves a few years ago. We are now looking at getting to the next goal post, which is a longer-term goal post of the target of Rs 300 ARPU. The movement in ARPU we have seen reflects the power of our premiumization approach that I have talked about earlier. What is driving this premiumization, feature phone to smartphones gives us an upgrade or feature phone to smartphone gives us an ARPU upside. The 5.6 million 4G net ads is a clear ARPU upside there. Prepaid to postpaid is one area where ARPU pretty much doubles. The third area is data consumption and monetization.

I think there are two parts to the question, one is FWA itself and the other is slicing. I think non-standalone also allows you to do slicing, the 3GPP standards are clear about this. There have been experiments that we have already carried out, it does allow you to do slicing. So if those applications you need 15 different slices at some point in time, yes, you need standalone, but that is nowhere near the horizon at best you will have one slice on FWA or two slices, these kind of slices are totally possible in a NSA network. Second remember the spectrum is unutilized it is a network that is empty so even if you slice it what is the value because it is an empty network so whether you give it, you give a small slice, or you give a whole slice it does not really matter. So I would say that, that is still perhaps in the distant future as the networks fill out that you need to slice and so on and so forth, but technically you can slice even on an NSA network.', 'that they use on this little device that we carry in our pockets is really messaging or some video or some browsing, and as a consequence 4 to 6 Mbps is more than adequate and it is at a point of indifference beyond that.

Just if you can give us a bit more color on the medium-term outlook for ARPU Rs 300 obviously is the longer-term plan now it is Rs 200 with all the levels that you have described with postpaid and what you have just said, how should we think of the next few quarters in terms of our ARPU. ","The company aims to see some improvement in ARPU every few months organically. The recent increase in ARPU to Rs 200 from Rs 193 is a positive step towards the longer-term goal of reaching Rs 300. Factors such as the shift from feature phones to smartphones, increase in postpaid subscriptions, and data consumption and monetization strategies are expected to contribute to the growth in ARPU over the next few quarters.","['Aditya Suresh - Macquarie\n\nThank you.\n\nDeepti - Moderator\n\nThe next question comes from Mr. Yungjuen Yeoh. Mr. Yeoh you may please unmute your side, introduce yourself, and ask your question now.\n\nYungjuen Yeoh - A R capital\n\nThank you for the opportunity. I was just curious on the ARPU.

Thanks.\n\nGopal Vittal - Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer, Bharti Airtel Limited\n\nI am afraid, I would not be able to give you a number there, but I think that like I said suffice it to say that we would be disappointed in ourselves, if we do not see some improvement in ARPU equating for days and all of that on an organic basis every few months. So I just leave it at that.\n\nYungjuen Yeoh - A R capital', 'Let me switch to a quick update on each of our segments. In the mobile business we added 5.6 million 4G net ads. Postpaid, this quarter saw a significant acceleration and contributed almost 26% of the overall net ads for the quarter coming in at 833k net ads. The ARPU got to Rs 200 versus Rs 193 in quarter four. This as you know is the first goal post we set for ourselves a few years ago. We are now looking at getting to the next goal post, which is a longer-term goal post of the target of Rs 300 ARPU. The movement in ARPU we have seen reflects the power of our premiumization approach that I have talked about earlier. What is driving this premiumization, feature phone to smartphones gives us an upgrade or feature phone to smartphone gives us an ARPU upside. The 5.6 million 4G net ads is a clear ARPU upside there. Prepaid to postpaid is one area where ARPU pretty much doubles. The third area is data consumption and monetization. This is really driven through a very, very strong mix of contextual targeting,', ""155, the entry level smartphone pricing where you offer meaningful amounts of data is Rs 239. So you do see a almost a 50% jump as people move from a feature phone to a smartphone, and that is a function of how many users moved in a certain quarter so you could do the math and arrive at what ARPU you can get. The second source of growth is prepaid to postpaid and there again you see almost a 50% to 60% jump in ARPU actually more than that probably 75% jump in ARPU and if we can drive the postpaid net additions up from the 833k number that we have done this quarter to even higher than that, then again you see a shift in ARPU. The third source of ARPU is data monetization and I did mention this in the past where the moment the data allowance runs out on an impulse basis we offer a GB of data, 2 GB of data, 5 GBs of data, if you are at multiple price points. So just imagine at 10 o'clock in the night or 6 in the evening you run out of data you get a message right there at 5:58 knowing that you want to run out"", 'Yes, I think it is a good question, a big increase in ARPU can only happen with a reset of the tariff table, and as you know we are at the lowest levels of the world both in terms of rate per GB on data as well as average revenue per user on both. If you go to plot rate per GB of data on the X-axis and average revenue per use on the Y-axis, India will be at the bottom left-hand corner relative to all the other markets in the world including markets in South Asia or sub-Saharan Africa or anywhere in the world. So the big increases will really come from a tariff reset, but within the confines of the challenges that we operate with in a competitive market we have seven levers like I mentioned I think prepaid or feature phone to smartphone you get a ARPU upside, the entry level feature phone price plan is at Rs 155, the entry level smartphone pricing where you offer meaningful amounts of data is Rs 239. So you do see a almost a 50% jump as people move from a feature phone to a smartphone, and that is a function']","I am afraid, I would not be able to give you a number there, but I think that like I said suffice it to say that we would be disappointed

"First on the 5G side, one of your peer has said that they are through with the 65% of the rollout and it appears that in the first stage they will be doing 175000 towers. Where are we in comparison as far as the 5G rollout goes?","The company is not in a race regarding the 5G rollout. They have mentioned that they are focusing on non-standalone technology to improve coverage by 30%. The company is already present across urban India and expanding into rural areas. They are cautious about the impact of 5G on user experience, as current speeds of 200-300 Mbps may not be significantly noticeable to users who primarily use messaging, video, and browsing applications on their devices.","['Transcript of Bharti Airtel Limited First Quarter Ended June 30, 2023 Earnings Conference Call\n\nDeepti - Moderator\n\nThe next question comes from Mr. Sanjesh Jain. Mr. Jain you may please unmute your side introduce yourself and ask your question now.\n\nSanjesh Jain - ICICI Securities\n\nThanks Gopal for taking my question. First on the 5G side, one of your peer has said that they are through with the 65% of the rollout and it appears that in the first stage they will be doing 175000 towers. Where are we in comparison as far as the 5G rollout goes. That is number one and associated question is on each side when we deploy the 5G what is the kind of data capacity upgrade we do.\n\nGopal Vittal - Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer, Bharti Airtel Limited', 'So for the same block or spectrum whatever is the capacity of 4G, 5G would have a capacity which is roughly between 4 to 5 times. Let me try and explain this in a different way Sanjesh. On average we have about 50 to 60 megahertz of spectrum across the country deployed on 4G, and the petabytes that we have on our network. You also know that we are still not a congested network, we still have headroom from further capacity even on a 4G network. So let us assume that the capacity utilization is 60%-65% which means that based on the petabytes that we are pumping out you can see what is the upside on that same tranche of 50 to 60 megahertz. Here you have got a 100 megahertz spectrum. So number one is a double of the spectrum, so you can straight away double that, number two is it is more spectrally efficient. So you get another 50% to 60% increase in that. So therefore I think that there is a long runway for 5G to start filling up. It is a empty network and it will remain so for some time to come.', 'Like I mentioned Kunal we are seeing about 30% of offload, so in a site where there is both 4G and 5G depending on the devices, and depending on what the traffic is, we see up to a 30% offload of this traffic from 4G networks to 5G networks. It is still early days because the overall installed base is still low it is 14%-15% it is not grown at the rate that we were expecting it to grow. Even today 5G shipments are only about 48% of the total shipments. So it is still moving slowly and it will take time for the full upgradation to happen. The way I think about monetization as I mentioned is at an aggregate ARPU level. So for us the monetization levers is feature phone to smartphone, prepaid to postpaid, data monetization, and finally of course if there is a tariff increase, and that gives you a monetization as well. The capex that we are putting in is largely on 5G we are not putting any 4G capacity capex other than the rollout of rural sites, which is really a coverage related capex. So the way we look at', 'I think that is the second question. I do not have the precise numbers I think Soumen may have the number on the radar capacity upgrade, it is a very substantial increase that happens almost about 5x to 7x but I think Soumen will probably be able to give you a better answer on that. On the first part of your question Sanjesh we are not in any race here. I think I have mentioned before that the non-standalone technology allows us to get a 30% improvement in coverage. So today we are pretty much all across Urban India we are also going into rural, but at the same time we are also very carefully watching with some concern that the impact of 5G is not necessarily moving the experience needle at all because it is not that people even realize that they are getting speeds of 200 - 300 Mbps given the fact that the applications that they use on this little device that we carry in our pockets is really messaging or some video or some browsing, and as a consequence 4 to 6 Mbps is more than adequate and it is at a point']","I do not have the precise numbers I think Soumen may have the number on the radar capacity upgrade, it is a very substantial increase that happens almost about 5x to 7x but I think Soumen will probably be able to give you a better answer on that.",Bharti Airtel.pdf

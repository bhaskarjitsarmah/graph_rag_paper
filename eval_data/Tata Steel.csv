I think, sometime back when we had an Investor Day, we essentially said, and I think I can remember I was criticised for saying that, why is your Net debt to EBITDA target so high. Because you would be swimming in money. But I think we have taken the right call to say that it will be between 2x and 2.5x. That Net debt to EBITDA goal will continue to be there. It is not something that we have on a QoQ basis, but certainly on a YoY basis, we will try to adhere to those levels including with the higher capital allocation. But if there are extraordinary costs that comes in because of events such as the blast furnace relining in Europe, those kinds of things do have to be absorbed to ensure sustainability of the business.

The Net debt to EBITDA is a frame that we are looking at. Earlier, we said 2x - 2.5x, if you recall, when we had that conversation on the Investor Day. That continues to be our frame. The $1 billion debt reduction number is also a number that we will continue to pursue, but the question is – for example, this quarter, we had about Rs. 7,200 crores of repayment which partly we had to refinance. So that's why you don't see it in this, because the working capital increase and the capex increase have offset that number, and as a result of which, you see a Rs. 71,000 crores net debt number. Going forward, in the next quarter, we have Rs. 4,500 crores, part of which will be repaid. So, we will continue to do that on a gross basis, but the fact is that our allocation of capex is also increasing.

Is there any one-off in that?","The reported improvement in realisation per ton this quarter was higher than the previously guided amount due to factors such as the contract and product mix, which impact net realisations differently from the benchmark, and the ongoing relining of one of the blast furnaces in Europe. These factors contributed to the higher improvement in realisations compared to the initial guidance.","[""# Amit Murarka, Axis Capital\n\nSure. And is that possible to quantify, like what could be the hit of those hedges in 1Q?\n\n# Samita Shah: VP CFTRM – Tata Steel Limited\n\nYes. So, we can share the details with you. And just to add, in FY22, actually, we benefited from the hedges. If you see how the spot prices had moved because we had hedges in place, our costs were actually much lower in FY23. In FY24, we will see some of that impact, and we can share the number with you.\n\n# Amit Murarka, Axis Capital\n\nSure. My next question is also on Europe.

Narendran: CEO & MD - Tata Steel Limited"", 'Moving to Europe, our steel deliveries were around 2 million tons in the first quarter. Revenue per ton was up about £33 per ton on a QoQ basis. As we had explained in the past, our contract and product mix ensure that our net realisations are different from the benchmark, which is Northwest Europe HRD spot, with a one quarter lag. In the previous quarter, the drop in NRs was 50% lower than the decline in the benchmark; and consequently, the improvement in this quarter was also correspondingly lower. Overall, the high revenue per ton was offset by elevated input costs, including energy and the ongoing relining of one of the blast furnaces in Netherlands. We had guided last quarter as well, that the blast furnace would be down for relining. That will obviously impact 1Q and 2Q for us.', ""We'll come back to you on this. But lastly, if I remember right, both the cost guidance and the net realisation guidance for 1Q compared to 4Q was pretty close to what we have guided. And basically, our guidance for 2Q is £38 per ton reduction in realisations in Europe and about Rs. 3,200 per ton reduction in realisations in India. To some extent, this is to be supplemented by coking coal consumption prices reducing by about $50 per ton in both Europe and in India. In 1Q compared to 4Q, the guidance on the coal consumption was also close to what we guided.\n\nSamita Shah: VP CFTRM – Tata Steel Limited\n\nYes. Just to add to that, Amit, while the NRs and the coal guidance we've discussed, I think there were some additional costs because of the cold rolled mill taking a little more time to stabilise. And of course, the blast furnaces being down. So, some of these costs have actually impacted the profitability, which is what you're seeing.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Indrajit Agarwal of CLSA."", ""Looking ahead, in India, the domestic demand remains supported by government spending and improving consumption across end-use segments. However, the drop in international prices and seasonality have dampened prices. We expect a drop in realisations of around Rs. 3,100 per ton in 2Q compared to 1Q, but we will, of course, benefit from the drop in coking coal consumption by about $57 per ton on QoQ basis. In Europe, our net realisations are expected to drop by about £38 per ton. Coking coal consumption is expected to improve by about $46 per ton QoQ. The ongoing relining, as I've mentioned earlier, of one of the blast furnaces is taking time and will obviously continue to impact costs in the second quarter as it did in the first quarter.

In Netherlands, our relining will get completed more around the end of next quarter, the early part of the third quarter. And from third quarter, onwards, I think Netherlands will certainly come back to its normal operating levels. Maybe, the second half of the third quarter, onwards, it will certainly come back to its operating level. We expect that Netherlands will continue to be strong in the context of the market that exists there. And it has, historically, if I look at last decade of numbers, it has always, as Naren mentioned, been a PAT-positive and a cash-positive business, so we expect to do that. We are also taking a lot of efforts in terms of structurally improving that. And that is going to have a cost impact or cost takeout impact, but it will not happen in this year [inaudible].

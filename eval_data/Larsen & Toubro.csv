So, can you highlight on what stage we are in terms of closures and most likely when we get approval, there's money coming in?|\n|P. Ramakrishnan:|So, at this juncture, as you may be aware, IDPL is a holding company that has 8 operating road assets and one transmission line asset. The approvals from agencies like NHAI, Ministry of Road and Surface Transport and other customers is in the progress. The target is to try to complete it in Q2, but there is a possibility it can slip over to Q3.|\n|Parikshit Kandpal:|Last question sir is on the Real estate. I think, SNS has some time back said that they are targeting to be a top 5 player and Rs 10,000 crores is a target for presales by FY '25. So, wanted a sense, what is the number for Q1 FY '24 on the Real Estate business?|"", ""P. Ramakrishnan: So I think that once again, we had articulated quite in detail when we closed FY '23 in the month of May when we gave the guidance of 9% for Projects and Manufacturing with a clear qualifier that the first 6 months could be a little subdued on the back of a major part of the jobs\n---\n# Larsen & Toubro Limited\n\nJuly 25, 2023\n\nthat we have secured until 2020-21, which is COVID year and thereafter, when they went into execution, they had the additional brunt of higher commodity prices.\n\nSo a major part of these jobs should get completed in the first half or possibly definitely by Q3 of the current year. And it is basis this construct that we have given a guidance of 9% for the full year with a clear view that the first 6 months for Infra could be a little subdued.\n\nModerator: Next question is from the line of Ashish Shah from JM Financial Limited."", ""P. Ramakrishnan: So Mohit, if you recall, when we did our earnings call for Q3 FY '23 in January, we still had a similar question. And as you know, that this year, we all are aware that the first 3 quarters for India could be really busy. And there is always a chance that because of the impending general elections, although the dates have not been announced, we have to be mindful of it. So we are taking into account this aspect. Although Q1 order inflow has been reasonably robust. But as you know, the ordering momentum can be a little lumpy sometimes. So let's see, as we get into Q2, Q3, I think we'll have a better visibility to talk about revising the guidance."", ""As far as order inflows are concerned, we will still maintain that 10% to 12% trajectory. On the revenue execution part, we had given a guidance of 12% to 15% and I'm happy to say that the Q1 revenue growth has been reasonably good. But Q2, as far as the project is concerned, can have some impact because of the seasonal monsoon and all. Q2 will definitely at least give us a clear visibility in terms of the execution momentum that will flow into Q3, Q4 and maybe at that point of time we can have a better comfort on seeing whether we possibly can touch the on the higher side of the revenue guidance. But at this stage, it is premature to conclude. So we still maintain the band of 12 to 15 percent.\n\nMohit Kumar: Understood. And my second question is on the margins. The core margin Y-o-Y were weak. So when do you think the impact of the legacy projects will wear off? And are these orders before FY '21?""]","So, at this juncture, as you may be aware, IDPL is a holding company that has 8 operating road

"Could you give some color on what is driving this increase, whether it is onshore,
offshore hydrocarbons, overseas or domestic and so on?",The increase in Hydrocarbon prospects is being primarily driven by both domestic and overseas projects. The total prospects are divided into Rs 1 trillion for offshore and Rs 2.5 trillion for onshore projects.,"[""Similarly, for offshore wind also, we are looking to increase our capabilities out there, leveraging our offshore hydrocarbon competencies that we have.\n\nModerator: Next question is from the line of Deepak Krishnan from Macquarie. Deepak your voice is breaking. The next question is from the line of Ankita Shah from Elara Capital.\n\nAnkita Shah: So, given the very strong prospect pipeline that we have, and you are expecting a good momentum in flows going forward. So, what is the kind of capacity expansion in terms of capex that you're looking at?"", ""Renu Baid: Got it. And can you share from which sectors the Rs 17 bn orders were de-booked during the quarter.\n\nP. Ramakrishnan: Sorry, I didn't get you.\n\nRenu Baid: The Rs 1700 crores orders, which were deleted from the backlog are from which segment?\n\nP. Ramakrishnan: Largely in the B&F real estate sector. It was an old order that was not moving, that was almost Rs 1,000 crores. The rest is all a combination of various orders which after the completion is no longer required, so they get deleted.\n\nRenu Baid: Got that. Thanks.\n\nModerator: Thank you. Next question is from the line of Sumit Kishore from Axis Capital Limited. Please go ahead.\n\nSumit Kishore: Thank you so much PR. My first question is on Hydrocarbon prospects which have increased sharply. Could you give some color on what is driving this increase, whether it is onshore, offshore hydrocarbons, overseas or domestic and so on?"", 'P. Ramakrishnan: I think I gave you the breakup of Hydrocarbons, both over domestic and overseas. So, the total Hydrocarbon prospects is at Rs 3.47 trillion, okay. I think you can take Rs 1 trillion as offshore and Rs 2.5 trillion as onshore.\n\nPage 13 of 19\n---\n# Sumit Kishore:\n\nGot it. The second question is while the defense prospects for the balance fiscal seem to have gone down as included in that number for Heavy engineering, Defense, and Green Energy EPC. But I mean, clearly, what we are reading in terms of your press releases, on L&T co-developing AIP technology with DRDO, the prospect of P75 I, even the lightweight tanks that we are reading about. Over what time frame and how large can these opportunities be in Defense, if you could give some color?\n\n# P. Ramakrishnan:', ""Aditya Mongia:    Maybe I'll just kind of ask a related question over here, not a new one. See your subsidiaries in KSA have seen a lot of volatility in the top line. I don't know whether that is indicative of the way things happen in KSA, but what is changing at this point of time for us to be believing that the change in mindset over there is something that can lead to medium-term gains for us, which are more sustainable?\n\nP. Ramakrishnan:  So, when you talk about medium-term gains, I'm sure you're referring to margins. I did mention that Hydrocarbon margin has been consistently in that 9% to 10% band over the last two years or so. And with the kind of order book that we have across both India and outside India, I don't see any reason for us to comment upon whether there would be a significant upturn in margins or a downturn.""]","I think I gave you the breakup of Hydrocarbons, both over domestic and overseas.

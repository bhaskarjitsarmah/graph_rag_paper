Sir, my first question is on the gross margin side. So, if you see on a quarter-on-quarter basis, the margins have come off by about 200 bps. So, if you can first sort of help us understand the impact from various segments, like you said there was one negative mix impact and commodity cost as well, so if you can break it up into the similar segments which has led to this impact?\n\nAnd second is on the price hikes, any price hikes you have taken in the current quarter, in Q2 after the first quarter, which maybe should help the margins going ahead?']","But let me say price versus cost seems well balanced out at the moment. And then you got to look at the two other factors, which is essentially operating leverage. So as business builds back, as volumes grow and as revenues start to build back there is an element of operating leverage that will come in. But yes, there could be a potential drag on mix coming in from our stated ambition and aspiration to grow the EV Chetak. And as exports and Boxers start to come back. So, there could be mix headwinds that we will see as we look forward.",Bajaj Auto.pdf
What is the expected percentage company is looking –for the end of the year?,The expected percentage the company is looking for by the end of the year is between 3% to 4%.,"[""So anywhere between, let's say, 3% to 4% is what we would like to have seen it by the end of the year, doubling from the current 2%. But like I said, there is the new subsidy regime. There's a new normal that has to emerge. When you look at the EV market volumes from VAHAN, let's say, as an example, July run rates at the moment on EV 2-wheelers, looks very different from what it did in the pre-subsidy regime change. So, we need to wait and see how that plays out. But let me leave you with the thought –that it could be anywhere between 2% to 4%.\n\nAnjali: Thank you sir.\n\nModerator: The next question is from the line of Mitul Shah from DAM Capital.

In another 3 months, we'll have a rolling plan which sort of addresses the quarter 1 of next year.

You guys have been showing the booking numbers and they look encouraging.

I just wanted to understand what the percentage of electric vehicle of the sales is at present. And what is the expected percentage company is looking –for the end of the year?\n\nDinesh Thapar: Anjali, to give you a sense, we currently have sold about 20,000 units of Chetak, and a few hundred of our electric 3-wheelers that we just launched. So, that's about 2% when you look at it in the context of about 1 million units that we sell per quarter, right? So current run rate is 2% electric vehicles, pretty much most of it, electric 2-wheelers, a few hundred like I said 3-wheelers."", ""Where do we expect to see it by the end of the year?

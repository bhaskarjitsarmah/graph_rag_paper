Second question I had if you look at Krishnapatnam the margins have improved fairly significantly so can you help us understand the measures which are driving this margin improvement and the sustainability of this? Is there any one off in any of the other ports as well where the particular cargo or particular receipt is helping boosting the margins?', 'Charanjit Singh: No, there is no one off in any of the port items at any places. It is a clear reflection of the volumes which you see. So, the port has recorded the highest ever quarterly volumes and that is the reason for improved margins.\n\nAchal Lohade: Understood. If I may ask, the impact of this cyclone, you said six days kind of impacted our capacity so is there any way to estimate what is the impact in terms of revenue loss or the margins?\n\nKaran Adani: We lost 2 million tonnes of handling volume because of the cyclone.\n\nPage 5 of 14\n---\n# Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Limited\n\nAugust 08, 2023\n\nAchal Lohade:  And would that be covered in this quarter or that has gone for good?\n\nKaran Adani:   Sorry covered meaning.\n\nAchal Lohade:  I mean effectively that gets pushed in the following days and the quarter so will this be covered or compensated in the second quarter volume?']","You are right, actually it is about couple of percentage reduction, but it is by and large because of the mix but the important number to note is actually the port EBITDA which actually is at 72% and also in absolute terms the EBITDA has grown as well so you are absolutely right, it is mix.",Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Ltd.pdf
Okay and Sir have we taken the price hikes for FY2024?,"Yes, we have taken.","['Muthukumaran: Yes, we have taken.\n\nKaran Adani: We will see the full effect of price hike from July onwards.\n\nNikhil Abhyankar: Because if you can quantify the price hike or blended.\n\nKaran Adani: As you know that we keep guiding, it is around 2.5% of our total per tonne revenue.\n\nNikhil Abhyankar: Okay Sir. Thank you. That is all from me.\n\nModerator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Nikhil Nigania from Alliance Bernstein. Please go ahead.\n\nNikhil Nigania: Hi thank you for taking my question. I just have one question. So good to see strong set of numbers in the first quarter on volumes, but just on a longer guidance on 500 million tonnes in FY2025, now that most of the inorganic growth seems behind Krishnapatnam, Gangavaram, Karaikal, Haifa. Apart from Vizhinjam what else is maybe under evaluation or something in mind to help us get close to that kind of the 500 million tonne next fiscal.', 'Pulkit: Got it thank you for those answers.\n\nModerator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Nikhil Abhyankar from ICICI Securities. Please go ahead.\n\nNikhil Abhyankar: Thank you for the opportunity and congrats on a good set of numbers. Sir I just one question. Sir the realizations for Q1 are down on Y-o-Y and Q-o-Q basis is it purely because of the mix and have we taken the price hikes for the year?\n\nMuthukumaran: You are right, actually it is about couple of percentage reduction, but it is by and large because of the mix but the important number to note is actually the port EBITDA which actually is at\n\nPage 10 of 14\n---\n# Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Limited August 08, 2023\n\nNikhil Abhyankar: Okay and Sir have we taken the price hikes for FY2024?\n\nMuthukumaran: Yes, we have taken.\n\nKaran Adani: We will see the full effect of price hike from July onwards.\n\nNikhil Abhyankar: Because if you can quantify the price hike or blended.', 'Karan Adani: So far, we have not seen any pressures in the volume. You would have seen the July number also reflects the similar sort of growth that we are continuing so we do not foresee any slowdown as of right now.\n\nAchal Lohade: So, in that case Karan how do we explain 370-390? If I simply analyze 100 million it crosses actually 400 million mark for FY2024.\n\nKaran Adani: Achal we cannot be changing the guidance on a quarterly basis, right? Some plus some minuses can happen, right. So, we continue to grow. So, we are optimistic at the right point in time we might like to change the guidance, but not at this point in time.\n\nAchal Lohade: Understood.

Just wanted to clarify with respect to your capex guidance is there anything new which is building in this capex, or it is the same capital allocation what you had talked about in terms of ports earlier in the overall capex number of 4500 Crores?\n\nKaran Adani: Right now, there is no change in our capex guidance.

We have got the approval from the Maharashtra government and the land acquisition is under way right now. A lot of work to be done in terms of rejuvenating the existing jetties and the backup area, so we are working on that. The road connectivity which was also an issue we have used this year to finish that. We got four lane road connectivity all the way to the port, and we are confident that we will be able to create an alternate to JNPT at Dighi.\n\nAchal Lohade: Is there any capex guidance you can provide in this case for next three to four years at Dighi port.', 'Achal Lohade: Is there any capex guidance you can provide in this case for next three to four years at Dighi port.\n\nKaran Adani: It will be hard to give you a port-by-port guidance.

That predominant increase is because of Ocean Sparkle acquisition which we did last year.\n\nAchal Lohade: Got it. Thank you. That is all from my end.

We do not see any imbalance as an issue. In essence, we have actually seen more efficiencies coming in with the double stack counts increasing and especially with the DFC getting commissioned, we have seen the efficiency factors improving significantly.|""]","It will be hard to give you a port-by-port guidance.

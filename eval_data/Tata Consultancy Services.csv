We have our next question from the line of Ravi Menon from Macquarie. Please go ahead.\n\nRavi Menon: My question is about fresher hiring. So was there any fresher hiring this quarter or was the recruitment mostly lateral to backfill that ?\n---\n# Tata Consultancy Services Earnings Conference Call\n\nJuly 12, 2023, 19:00 hrs IST (09:30 hrs US ET)\n\nK Krithivasan: No. We continue to hire freshers and we'll hire this quarter as well and that will continue.\n\nRavi Menon: My next question is on last quarter's increase in onsite costs and whether that was due to new project starts. Have we continued to see new projects start this quarter and that got offset by some pressure on the book of existing business? Or we didn't really see any new project starts and cater it, that's why we kind of ended flat quarter-on-quarter on CC terms?"", ""Samir Seksaria: We saw new project starts with deal wins continuing to ramp up. We also had onsite movements happening incrementally in this quarter as well. And the net impact on revenue is due to the uncertainty on the existing projects or customers pausing their spend.\n\nRavi Menon: Let me ask one more follow-up from me on this deferral of contracts. Is this due to this whole change in model to Agile versus Waterfall? Is that causing people to be able to take this pause versus earlier you would really have for any deliverable, there would be months probably still to go. So you couldn't really halt everything mid-flight and now it makes it a lot easier to put these pauses?"", ""|Ankur Rudra:|I appreciate that. One last question on contract profitability. How is that progressing? I realize that, gross margins have continued to take a hit, probably due to wage hikes this time. But if you look at the full year in FY‘24, I know you expect margins to be clawed back. But do you think there is any chance that margins on a full year basis might actually not expand in FY‘24 or might even decline despite the supply easing up?|\n|---|---|\n|Samir Seksaria:|Ankur, all our efforts collectively will be towards improving margins. But right now, given the current macro, it's difficult to give a color in terms of how it would end up exactly. Rest assured all efforts are going towards improving the margins.|\n|Moderator:|Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that was the last question for today. I now hand the conference over to the management for closing comments.|"", ""K Krithivasan: You said we don't give quarterly guidance. I don't want to say anything on Q2, Sudheer.\n\nSudheer Guntupalli: Just one last question. Two consecutive quarters of strong deal booking despite the weak market, not even including the BSNL deal, and this quarter execution also, largely played out in line with your expectations, and we are seeing market situation improved a bit, especially regarding this one panic factor, and you're saying pipeline is strong. How do we reconcile it with your tone in general on the demand situation? Is there a bit of conservatism you're baking in your tone to provide a buffer for any unexpected shock, especially since you have just taken charge?""]",We saw new project starts with deal wins continuing to ramp up.

So manufacturing has held up quite well for us. So what is keeping this spend up in the manufacturing segment?,"The spend in the manufacturing segment is being sustained by factors such as the low base effect, delayed increase in demand and growth compared to other industries, and the gradual easing of supply chain challenges. Additionally, the continued high demand from automakers is a significant driver for the stability in the manufacturing segment.","[""So what is keeping this spend up in the manufacturing segment? And are we not facing the kind of delays that we are facing in, let's say, BFSI or other verticals, in the manufacturing segment? And do you think that manufacturing might continue to remain stable in the coming quarters as well?\n\nAnd a similar kind of opinion about retail. So in retail, we had seen a lot of weakness in the past couple of quarters. And again, not just for us, for the entire industry. Are there any signs of that segment bottoming out? If not today, maybe in a couple of quarters' time? Just a little bit color on these two verticals?"", ""K Krithivasan: I would say manufacturing is doing well because of the low base and the delayed pickup in demand and growth compared to other industries. And as the supply chain situation also eases slowly, customers are able to see the growth. Today you see the demand is still high for many of the automakers. I think that's probably driving it. And again, I won't be able to say how long this will last because it will eventually be a function of the overall economy.\n\nOn Retail, our view is, or what we see, the essential retail is doing well. But if it is luxury or fashion or other specialty retail, we find that there is a softness in demand in such sub-segments of the industry. So that's a broad color that we can provide you on these two verticals."", ""Vibhor Singhal: Got it. And on the manufacturing part, just a follow-up. Is it only the auto part of the manufacturing segment appearing stable at this point of time and looking to continue to spend? Or are the other sub-verticals in manufacturing also kind of stable?\n\nK Krithivasan: No, we don't provide that detailed color. I think, excepting one, quite a few of the sub-verticals are doing well. And our outlook may not even apply for the overall industry, as we also have significant market share gain in this segment, which is also driving our growth.\n\nPage 22 of 25\n---\n# Tata Consultancy Services Earnings Conference Call\n\nJuly 12, 2023, 19:00 hrs IST (09:30 hrs US ET)\n\nVibhor Singhal: Got it.

Krithi, just one question from my side on the two segments that we have seen quite contrasting performance in the past few quarters. So manufacturing has held up quite well for us. And not just for us, for all the companies across the industry. It's been quite stable in terms of growth. Even in this quarter, we almost have double digit growth on a Y-on-Y basis.""]","I would say manufacturing is doing well because of the low base and the delayed pickup in demand and growth compared to other industries.

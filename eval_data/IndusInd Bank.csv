So where are we in that journey?\n\nSumant Kathpalia: I think, you would see that the yield curve between 90 days to year is almost flat.

Don't forget, we have a book which is 45% corporate, 44% to 45% corporate book. On this book, you would see a margin suppression as because the MCLR or the EBLR will continue to change as we go forward. If they don't, you will start seeing the margin expansion. Otherwise, you will see what we've said, 4.2% to 4.3%. We are assuming that there will be a decline in the corporate yields as we move forward into quarter 3 and quarter 4. But yes, those will more or less be substituted by the gains, which we will get in the cost of deposits. So, in our opinion, our margins and if you look at six quarters in the presentation, we've been very stable and will continue to be stable in our margins.""]","So first of all, I'm comfortable with the 110 to 130 basis points, including the contingent reserve of INR400 crores to INR500 crores.

So firstly, on the slippages and the credit cost, credit cost is still at the upper end of the guidance. And when we look at it, in fact, we have utilized the INR200 crores of contingency buffer as well. And you highlighted earlier, that maybe, we are largely done with the utilization, and we will try to create further buffer as well.\n\nSo, how confident we would be with respect to the credit cost trajectory of 1.1% to 1.3% odd percent? And even on the slippages side, it seems we are relatively high, maybe you mentioned because of seasonality in 1Q.

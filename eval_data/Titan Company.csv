Last year, it was, I think, 47% new buyer contribution for the quarter, and this year, it's 46%. So yes, repeat buyers have grown at a faster rate than new buyers, but the percentage difference is only 1%. I wouldn't compare it to Quarter 4 because there is a seasonality element in whatever we do.\n\nAnd grammage growth, etcetera, is good, but actually grammage growth is not an operating KPI that management actually tracks very, very actively.

This quarter, we have seen about 35% non-Tanishq gold contribution and very interestingly, close to 15% Tanishq exchange also.

In the capital employed, we have seen against a INR 2,437 crores, our capital employed has gone up by almost INR 700 crores. So is it primarily because of the international portion or there is some element sitting in?"", ""|Jay Doshi:|Understood. Maybe take it offline some other time. Second question is on international market. Now your original guidance at the time of last year that investor meet was 30 stores by FY27, INR 3,000 crores top line -- or INR 2,500 crores top line. It will be at INR2,500 crores by end of this year. So should we expect that you will achieve that top line milestone or target much earlier than originally guided?|\n|---|---|\n| |And if there is something additional you can share in terms of how you're thinking about assortments and some other aspects of manufacturing as well as to market strategy to cater to the consumers in those markets?|""]","From a profitability standpoint, they are all doing pretty much better than what we had planned, while obviously, the costs are higher in operating these stores in international markets, the GC profile that we are getting from the stores are also substantially higher with the U.S. being even better than the GCC market.",Titan Company.pdf
The next question would be on Titan Eye+. How much is e-commerce as a percentage of sales?,"E-commerce contributes around 6% to 7% of sales for Titan Eye+, with a focus on the in-house e-commerce channel as well as sales through platforms like Flipkart and Amazon.","[""|Kuruvilla Markose:|So typically, each of these stores would consume something like $6 to $8 million in terms of inventory.|\n|---|---|\n|Siddhant:|Okay. The next question would be on Titan Eye+. How much is e-commerce as a percentage of sales? And what are we doing out there?|\n|Saumen Bhaumik:|This is Saumen. Our e-commerce contribution is in the ballpark of 6%, 7%, both combined our in-house brand channel as well as through Flipkart, Amazon. Flipkart, Amazon, we mostly sell sunglasses that too lower end, Fastrack products. And so focus is more on the in-house e-comm channel.

But the base figure is small.|\n| |So I was saying that while the in-house e-comm channel is doing better and focus is also on that, and we are seeing a visible lift in that channel sale. But in the foreseeable future, we still don't think the contribution of this channel will be more than 10%. It will be sub 10%.|"", ""So I've only picked out besides what we do for Akshaya Tritiya or what we will do for Festival of Diamonds during the activation period. Those are, let's say, more business as usual, but these four things which we did, and we are doing strongly, will continue to do so.\n\nThe second question that you asked me was, can you repeat that, new product share has been broadly in the 20% range, and it may vary from year-to-year, but 20% to 25% is a reasonable number because customers don't come that often, it's okay. Only some customers in certain categories may be coming once in six months or once in three months.\n\nSheela Rathi: Understood. And my second question, Ajoy, was while there is a lot of discussion around margins, which has happened. But with respect to the revenue growth, while you said that July\n\nPage 18 of 19\n---\n# Titan Company Limited\n\nAugust 2, 2023\n\nIt has been a good month for us.

I think there are a lot of data this time is not there. So maybe quantitatively, if you can help us, out of that 19%, what is the grammage growth? And the related question is that last quarter, we have seen a new buyer contribution at 49%, which has come at 46%. So I'm reading that we have been now trying to get heavy on the wedding segment, which has seen a 26% growth.

"Based on your experience so far, are you able to kind of get a sense or quantify what is the extent of additional growth that you can achieve if you make the gold exchange program, zero default gold exchange program more or less the default policy around the year?","It is challenging to estimate the extent of additional growth that could be achieved by making the gold exchange program a default policy throughout the year. The speaker mentioned that implementing such a policy consistently across markets is complex and may not have a straightforward impact on growth. The success of the gold exchange program seems to be influenced by various factors, and it may be more effective to strategically offer the program at different times rather than making it a default policy year-round.","[""# Moderator:\n\nThe next question is from the line of Jay Doshi from Kotak.\n\n# Jay Doshi:\n\nYes.

Typically, the non-Tanishq that is other outside gold typically contributes 30-31% of sales. This quarter, it happens to contribute with 35% of sales. So, but whether that will remain likewise in the rest of the quarter, it's difficult to say. It may range. It may vary between these 2. It's not something, which you should worry about structurally, does it change things? And does it actually make -- it's not a problem. As long as the payouts are under control, we are fine with it. So actually, it's a reasonably healthy and profitable growth engine.

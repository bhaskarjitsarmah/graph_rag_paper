Adjusted for settlement income in current & base period and brand divestment in base period, our sales for Qtr-1 grew 35% and our EBITDA grew 111%.\n---\n# Dr. Reddys Laboratories Limited\n\nJuly 26, 2023\n\nWe improved the drivers in our core businesses for sustainable growth through productivity improvements, market share gains and new product launches. We are making considerable progress across our strategic priorities.\n\nLet me take you through some of the key highlights of the quarter:', ""Bino Pathiparampil: Understood. Thank you.\n\nModerator: Thank you. We have the next question from the line of Ankush Mahajan from Axis Securities. Please go ahead.\n\nAnkush Mahajan: Thank you sir for providing me the opportunity and congrats for good set of numbers. Sir, this is the extension of the question that our base business is improving, and it seems from the number that our base business in the U.S. market and that has improved a lot. Can we say, sir, a high single-digit growth Q-o-Q in the base business? And I would like to really appreciate if you tell us that what are the factors behind that the base business is improving? What is happening in the U.S. market, sir, at this time in the generic?\n\nErez Israeli: So, I mentioned part of it is timing of RFPs, agreement with customers, shortage of some products and relatively lower than normal price erosion on the base. So, it's a combination of all of it.\n\nAnkush Mahajan: And can we expect this trend will continue?\n\nErez Israeli: It should. Yes.""]","The trade generic did not yet contribute much because we just recently launched it. And so, most of the growth happened from our branded generics, our key brands that we are focusing on. These trends are likely to continue also throughout the year and actually going to improve.",Dr. Reddy's Laboratories.pdf
We're seeing a lot of Dr. Reddy's name in terms of shortages of products in US. Are you seeing some opportunities meaningfully for us overcoming few quarters or are you planning to participate in some of them which could be potentially large for us?,"Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Limited is focusing on bringing a significant number of products to the Indian market in the next few years, with a strong emphasis on innovation as the main growth driver. The company aims to double its sales through innovation and the growth of its brands, including trade generics. While they do participate in opportunities that arise, they prioritize ensuring a stable supply for patients and do not solely rely on strategic growth through shortages in the market.","[""In terms of timing, as we signed the deal, then, of course, we'll need to allow some time for clinical trial, registration time and then, of course, the pickup of the brands as we are introducing those into the health care community. So, it will be kind of a pickup of the brands. So, every one of these brands will take a few years before it will come to its peak sales. But the beauty about it, these are through innovation, they are not switchable. And they're bringing a real solution for places that we believe that there is no such a solution or the solution that we're bringing is much better.\n\nCyndrella Carvalho: Okay. And just one last question. We're seeing a lot of Dr. Reddy's name in terms of shortages of products in US. Are you seeing some opportunities meaningfully for us overcoming few quarters or are you planning to participate in some of them which could be potentially large for us?"", ""Page 10 of 17\n---\n# Dr. Reddys Laboratories Limited\n\nJuly 26, 2023\n\nErez Israeli: The intent is to bring a significant number of products to the Indian market in the next coming years. The -- if everything will be successful, we're talking about tens of agreements like that, which we believe will be the main lever to bring us to top five. So if top five means that we need to double our sales give or take in the next coming years, that's the expectation that, the innovation will bring most of that value come into play, and the rest will come from the normal growth of the brands that we will have as well as the trade generics. So, the innovation will be the key focus and the main growth driver."", ""One, some of the branded generics will have a headwind in the future either because of the trade\ngeneric, either because of the digital channels, there will be certain level of potential switches\n\nPage 12 of 17\n---\n# Dr. Reddys Laboratories Limited\n\nJuly 26, 2023\n\nalso. And when we looked at our portfolio and we saw what brands we believe are long-term for us, we decided to focus on them and to divest those that we decided to not to focus on. At the same time, we have major efforts to bring a lot of innovative solution to India. And once this will pick up, this will bring us to the desired level even without acquisition. Acquisition, I'm happy to do with a reasonable price, with a reasonable risk, but we are not building on it. We can be top 5 even without it."", ""Erez Israeli: We do from time to time, but to be honest, I don't feel joy, when we are growing on the expense of others. I actually want the supply to be there for the patients. So, whenever it comes, we are taking it. But I don't see such a strategic growth lever. I'm happy to supply, if it helps patients, but actually wish that all the companies will be able to sell normally and not to see such a little growth, but it is coming to us as well from time to time.\n\nModerator: Thank you. We have the next question from the line of Tushar Manudhane from Motilal Oswal Financial Services. Please go ahead.\n\nTushar Manudhane: Yes. Particularly on the trade receivables as I see, there has been a good jump of almost INR400 crores, INR450 crores, both year-over-year or even quarter-over-quarter. Is this more or less linked to North America business? And is this more to fill up the channel and so the sales could moderate to some extent in the coming quarters?""]","We do from time to time, but to be honest, I don't feel joy, when we are growing on the expense of others.

"And just on extending to your launch aspects or other two products if you'd like to call out, which would be interesting launches over the next 12 months to 15 months in North America segment?","The upcoming launches in the North America segment over the next 12 to 15 months are focused on bringing innovation to India through licensing, product acquisitions, and potential partnerships with other players.

This quarter, again, we have launched 8 new products. And\nin the next two quarters or three quarters in this year, we are going to launch more products.\n\nSo, we have to look at the gross margin as a composite. Overall, the drivers of gross margin, as\nyou know, are -- the price erosion obviously brings it down, but we are seeing softening of\nsolvent prices. We are seeing softening of freight rates and so on. And we're also seeing\nfavourable product mix. So overall, I expect our gross margin to range between 56% to 59% in\nthe next few quarters.\n\nTushar Manudhane: Interesting.

Actually, Horizon 2, that we have discussed in the past is all about to bring innovation to India, mostly licensing in, some product acquisitions and some potential partnership with other players. These partnerships and that will likely to have an impact from FY '25, FY '26 onwards. FY '24, which I believe we will grow, significant will come primarily by the core and branded generics focused brands that we have. Sorry for the long answer. Yes.\n\nYes, understood. Second on, in your remarks, you also mentioned approvals in China. Now if I look at my ROW business excluding Russia and CIS, we are pretty much in the range that we've been doing for the last four quarters, five quarters, the INR400 crores range. When do we see meaningful contribution start from China or when do we see -- how does the step up from this level happen in the Emerging Market business?"", '# Moderator:\n\nThank you. The next question is from the line of Cyndrella Carvalho from JM Financial. Please go ahead.\n\n# Cyndrella Carvalho:\n\nYes. Congratulations on a great set of numbers. Bringing question back to India, you mentioned about the innovative products, two products that you have signed for India. You mentioned about mother and child. You spoke about gummies. So, if -- and the generic division. So, what kind of investment are we envisaging in all these three different categories that we are talking, which is consumer health, generic-generic business and getting the in-licensed product?

Please go ahead.\n\nDamayanti Kerai: Continuing on the US business. So Erez, you mentioned even without Lena, the base business has grown very well for you sequentially. So, can you elaborate a bit more, whether you're seeing a lot of supply opportunities emerging in the market due to problems at some of the competitors, etcetera? And do you believe these opportunities will sustain for next few quarters? That's my first question.\n\nErez Israeli: So it's a combination of timing of RFPs, combination of set of situation that happen to products in which we could supply more, not necessarily a supply shortage, but it could be service or other supply disruption situation that happens, and also activities that we did with certain customers as well. So overall, let's say, it's primarily volume-based growth that's based on the agreements that we have with customers.""]",I don't want to call out specifically. We're trying to avoid it because after that we have a lot of discussion on this product. But what we can say is that we believe that we can sustain also the level of activities in North America even post lenalidomide because we have quite a few of very high-value products if we can bring to the market.,Dr. Reddy's Laboratories.pdf

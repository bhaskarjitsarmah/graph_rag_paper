"Could you give some NSR guidance like you gave for coking coal, similarly NSR, if you can?","It is challenging to provide specific NSR guidance due to market uncertainties. However, the cost benefits from lower coking coal and iron ore prices are expected to positively impact costs and margins in the upcoming quarter. The overall average price for the quarter may be supported by automotive price contract negotiations. The cost benefits are likely to offset any negative impacts of price changes in the next quarter.","[""Amit Murarka: Could you give some NSR guidance like you gave for coking coal, similarly NSR, if you can?\n\nJayant Acharya: It's difficult to give an NSR guidance because markets will not be in our hands. But I think it would be fair to say that the cost benefit of the lower coking coal prices and some impact of the recent iron ore price reductions would flow into our costs and therefore, reduce our costs in this quarter. And that would essentially help the margins. So, the margins should be range-bound. And on an absolute number, things will improve since the volume is expected to be better.\n\nAmit Murarka: Sure. And in terms of the power and fuel cost, generally again, energy prices have fallen. So, is there an expectation of, let's say, INR500-1,000 drop on that front as well?\n\nRajeev Pai: Yes. So, power and fuel cost is lower because of lower thermal coal prices and also natural gas prices. That's the basic driver of lower power and fuel cost during the current quarter."", ""The cost impact to that extent, we could mitigate. Going forward into Q2, as we said, the coking coal costs in Q1 went up by US$11 to US$285. We expect that the benefit of the lower coking coal prices will now flow into Q2, which would give us a benefit of US$45 to US$50 per tonne, which would offset some of the price drops, which have happened in Q1, which will flow into Q2.\n\nHowever, the volumes additionally in Q2 are expected to be better on better demand as we've seen today, although there is a monsoon impact, but we look forward to better demand, and we will also be able to liquidate some of the inventories, which have been held up at the ports.

One is coking coal prices, which would flow in and benefit the cost, some impact of better iron ore prices, which we expect in this quarter.

We see some price corrections in India in the last quarter, but we feel that more correction would be coming in the coming months. And thereafter, the iron ore prices may remain range bound.

So, the 23 million tonnes demand incrementally this year from the rest of the world will play out. And if the export from China reduces with the reduction in production, then that would be a positive as we go into the second half.\n\nAs far as your second question is concerned, I was not too clear, but I gather that you said U.S. and India are discussing on certain duty relaxations from India to U.S. and that would open up some markets.

So World Steel expected that the China demand would go up by 18 million tonnes or so and the rest of the world would go up by 23 million tonnes in this calendar year. While we feel that the rest of the world demand may still play out to be in that range, but the China demand growth of 18 million tonnes will probably be lower. That is something which we need to factor in on the overall number. So, our estimates are that the growth instead of additional 40 million tonnes which was given, about 2.3% growth, would be slightly lower because of the China demand situation.']","So, we would say that exports at this level, by and large, would continue.

Benefits of the lower coking coal will flow through in the coming quarters in Q2 and will offset some of the price fall impact in the last quarter, which will flow into Q2 as well.']","Yes.

The first one is on the production side. We mentioned that in the quarter gone by, we had 92% capacity utilization due to maintenance shutdowns. I understand that there will be some destocking of inventory that will happen at our end. So, are we planning to take any maintenance shutdown in Q2?

And at Ohio, we have about 1.5 million tonnes of capacity in terms of crude steel production. We are adding 9 million tonnes of capacity in this remaining 2 years upto FY '25, which would take our capacity in India to 37 million tonnes, by and large. And we have a potential now to add in the medium term by 2030-31, capacities in our brownfield sites, which is at Vijayanagar, Dolvi and Jharsuguda, which is at a low specific investment cost, and that's why we would like to focus on these first.\n\nPage 7 of 16\n---\n# JSW Steel Limited\n\nJuly 21, 2023"", ""Moderator: Next question is from the line of Sumangal Nevatia from Kotak Securities.\n\nSumangal Nevatia: Okay. Sir, my first question is with respect to long-term capacity potential, which we've discussed on Slide number 7. There, I mean if you look at next 6 years, we are just talking about a potential of 13 million tonnes, which is just a 5% CAGR, and we've grown in the last decade much faster than that. So I just want to understand that, why? And on the same slide, we are talking about brownfield potential at each of our sites of 5 million tonnes each and also greenfield at Odisha. So why are we not including this capacity potential in our FY '31 target of 50 million tonnes? So just want to understand if there is something I'm missing here."", ""As we said, incremental demand every year is now at 10 to 11 million tonnes and maybe a little better. So therefore, if you were to take typically even half of that is flat. So your demand of 5 to 6 million tonnes of flat demand would be there. And that is what will get met. As a matter of fact, that capacity which is coming up, will probably just be sufficient to meet the local domestic demand. So, with this capacity addition, I don't see a concern as of now.\n\n# Moderator\n\nThank you very much. I now hand the conference over to the management for closing comments.\n\n# Jayant Acharya""]","So, the shutdowns were planned. Usually, in the first quarter of the year, you have annual

"I think there was an imposition of about 25% duty on
aluminum and steel getting imported from India in 2018. And there seems to be some amount
of relaxation coming in from there?",There appears to be some relaxation in the duty on aluminum and steel imports from India to the U.S. following the imposition of a 25% duty in 2018.,"['But having said that, it is good to see that in spite of an export from China almost in the range of 44 million tonnes, which has happened in H1, the demand in the rest of the world has help up, and that grows to substantiate the fact that the rest of the world demand is able to grow well. So, the 23 million tonnes demand incrementally this year from the rest of the world will play out. And if the export from China reduces with the reduction in production, then that would be a positive as we go into the second half.\n\nAs far as your second question is concerned, I was not too clear, but I gather that you said U.S. and India are discussing on certain duty relaxations from India to U.S. and that would open up some markets. Is that what you asked?\n\nTarang Agrawal: Yes, from what I understand is, I think there was an imposition of about 25% duty on aluminum and steel getting imported from India in 2018. And there seems to be some amount of relaxation coming in from there?', ""The second is, there are quite a few capacities coming in from the steel players starting from FY24-25. So how do you see that impacting the price, especially for the flat segment? And third, in the last interaction that India had with the U.S., there has been some amount of duty reduction that we've seen for steel and aluminum. And given the price differential between Indian prices and prices there, if one were to adjust for freight and if there are carbon taxes, it would still be lucrative to probably supply from here. So just wanted to get your view."", 'Indrajit: Sure. This is helpful. Second, can you give us some idea about what is happening in the import market? Are you seeing some bit of cheaper imports on China, some shipments being booked in India? Or do you see some cheaper imports arriving on Indian shores over the next couple of months?\n\nJayant Acharya: Imports in this quarter Y-o-Y have gone up. So, while it has gone down Q-o-Q, but I think we would keep an eye on this. What we see today, however, is that the domestic price of steel and the international price of steel are not very far off. So therefore, the incentive to import for better prices, that propensity is less. People would not like to take a risk to import something when the price gap is low. Therefore, while we keep a watch, especially on the zero-duty imports, which are happening, I feel that imports also will moderate a bit given the price environment where the domestic market currently is.\n\nModerator: Next question is from the line of Satyadeep Jain from Ambit Capital.', 'Jayant Acharya: So, we would say that exports at this level, by and large, would continue. I would say, 15% plus/minus a bit will be the exports, so maybe 12%, what we had, 12% to 13%, which we had last year as a whole and has now been at 15% because last year was primarily impacted by the export duty. As you are aware, JSW Steel has a wide range in terms of customers as well as geographies to which we export almost 100 countries, 100 touch points, various product lines, which we do. So we would like to continue to do our exports and maintain our presence.

discussion that certain lines and certain products they are looking at exempting, so we would
look forward to some direction and clarity on this once this is decided between both the
countries. That would certainly be a positive and open up further avenues for trade with U.S.

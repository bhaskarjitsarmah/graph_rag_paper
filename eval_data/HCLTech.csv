Maybe one last question on Gen AI and thank you for all the color you've shared. Just curious about how you're seeing this playing out in the marketplace in contracts. Given you have a high participation in some of the cost takeout deals, maybe on the cloud side, is this showing up in discussions as a source of price deflation that maybe you or competitors are driving and hence might impact your contract profitability going forward?\n\n# C. Vijayakumar:\n\nSo, Ankur, at this point, most of the conversations on Gen AI are more innovation-led and we have not seen, I mean, obviously customers are always challenging us to demonstrate the art of the possible. And at this point, I don't see anyone trying to take the contractual position of how much we have to deliver through this technology because there are too many dependencies. So I think, there is definitely a lot of hype in the short run, but we do believe it will have some meaningful benefits in the long run."", ""C. Vijayakumar: So I think, the deals are different, nature of deals are different. Some of them have an ability to convert to revenue faster and that's the nature of deals that we have and that's what is driving this.\n\nKawaljeet Saluja: All right. That's the final question on profitability. Prateek, what is the kind of a tailwind that you'll get from profitability through possibly, change in the compensation revision cycle for this year?"", ""Now, I think, one of the key benefits are going to be around efficiency. So which means there will be some deflation, but I think it's at least two to three years away. And I do believe, it will get offset with so many projects in a few weeks, you have 140 projects, some of them pilots, some of them implementation, some of the examples that I shared earlier as well. So, I think there is going to be a little more uptake on small projects, which are really looking at proof of concepts and some implementation. And maybe gradually as it matures, there's going to be some more focus on how much efficiency it can drive. And I see that at least two to three years away at this point.\n\n# Ankur Rudra:\n\nAppreciated. Thank you and best of luck.\n\n# C. Vijayakumar:\n\nThank you.\n\n# Moderator:\n\nThank you.

That's what we are seeing.\n\n# Moderator\n\nThank you. The next question is on the line of Surendra Goyal from Citigroup. Please go ahead.\n\n# Surendra Goyal\n\nYes, thanks, sir.

"Is this what you were
anticipating given that you've maintained the guidance and also if you could characterize the
enterprise tech spend environment, despite seasonality and the strong deal wins that you had in
the past?","The company has a strong track record of meeting its guidance and remains confident in its ability to deliver on the guidance despite challenges in the macro environment. The focus is on efficiency-led programs to offset any moderation in discretionary spending, with a belief that certain verticals are performing better than others. The company is tracking its pipeline and expects strong bookings in the upcoming quarter, with a strategy to quickly translate deals into revenue.","[""Moderator: Thank you very much. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. The first question is on the line of Ankur Rudra from J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.\n\nAnkur Rudra: Thank you for taking my question. My first question is on how the demand and revenue performance played out in the first quarter versus your expectation. Is this what you were anticipating given that you've maintained the guidance and also if you could characterize the enterprise tech spend environment, despite seasonality and the strong deal wins that you had in the past?"", ""Having said that, obviously this whole cycle, the way I'm seeing is - the discretionary spend is moderating and it is probably stabilizing at a certain level and the cost and efficiency led programs have to fill in the gap and create net incremental growth. We believe that the state has achieved in three of our verticals, Manufacturing, Financial services and Life Sciences. And the other verticals are a little bit lagging behind.\n\nSo we are also tracking the pipeline and the maturity of the pipeline a portion of the large cost efficiency deals. And they seem to be on track. While our booking has been soft, we think we will deliver a strong booking in Q2.\n\nAnd if I look at the revenue translation of the deals that we expect to sign in Q2, there is a certain nature which helps us get revenue quickly. So I think that's really what we're seeing. And it's really a new cycle that's evolving, which is really offsetting the moderation in discretionary spend with growth and efficiency led programs."", ""if the uncertainty persists? And while you have large deals, if the softness in smaller deals continues, you might be at risk of at least reducing the upper end of the guidance?\n\n# C. Vijayakumar:\n\nWe've had a pretty good track record of looking at our pipeline, looking at our conversion and kind of, giving a guidance and meeting the guidance. So whenever we've given guidance in the last five years, we've delivered to it. So we believe, all the math behind it and all the judgment behind it is very robust. And it does factor in some of the challenges in the macro environment, which we did even when we gave the annual guidance. So I remain confident of delivering to the guidance this year.\n\n# Ankur Rudra:"", ""Ankur Rudra: Understand. I understand that it's very uncertain, the demand environment is difficult for you to spread it to play out exactly as you predicted at the beginning of the year. But do you think, maybe by maintaining your revenue guidance, you are potentially backing yourself into a corner\n\nPage 7 of 14\n---\n# HCL Technologies Limited\n\nJuly 12, 2023\n\nif the uncertainty persists? And while you have large deals, if the softness in smaller deals continues, you might be at risk of at least reducing the upper end of the guidance?\n\n# C. Vijayakumar:""]","it came in lower
than our own expectations. While all the large deals that we won, we really executed extremely
well. They all ramped up. They've all delivered good revenue growth as you can see in both Life
Sciences and Manufacturing verticals. And even in Financial services we've seen good growth.
Tech and telecom is where we saw more drops than what we had expected and we were
expecting some projects to go online, but towards the second half of the quarters, that did not
happen. So we did have people, we were ready and they did not really move forward. There
were a couple of instances, one Tech and Telecom. So it was disappointing for us to have that
situation, which not only declined our revenue, but it also had a big impact on our margins.",HCLTech.pdf
"Just the clarity in terms of the guidance, CVK, so do
you believe the 2Q conversion of deal pipeline into deal wins will also result into a better growth
from 2Q onwards, or do you expect the growth to pick up from 3Q?","The conversion of the deal pipeline into deal wins in the second quarter is expected to lead to better growth from that quarter onwards. Incrementally better growth is anticipated, with the possibility of a spike in one of the quarters.","[""Gaurav Rateria: All right, thank you.\n\nC. Vijayakumar: Thank you.\n\nModerator: Thank you. Next question is from Sandeep Shah from Equirus Securities. Please go ahead.\n\nSandeep Shah: Yes, thanks. Thanks for the opportunity. Just the clarity in terms of the guidance, CVK, so do you believe the 2Q conversion of deal pipeline into deal wins will also result into a better growth from 2Q onwards, or do you expect the growth to pick up from 3Q? Because historically, to achieve the guidance because of the high hurdle rate, even fourth quarter is being softer. So in that scenario, 2Q has to do a heavy lifting along with 3Q as well?\n\nC. Vijayakumar: So Sandeep, we don't give a quarterly view, but as I said, even in the beginning of the year, the quarters will get incrementally better. That was the commentary that I made even when we presented the guidance. So, you should see incrementally better growth and obviously, this means there's going to be spike in one of the quarters.

We have some reasonable level of confidence on accomplishing the outcomes that we expect.\n\nKawaljeet Saluja: So, CVK, I should thank, and Prateek, thank you for that fantastic color. I really appreciate it. The question really is that for you to achieve the guidance, you need a big spike up in the second quarter itself. Do you have that confidence? And the second related question to it is that normally in the cost takeout deals, consolidation deals, there's a free transition offered, there are timelines, like that sort of deal that you announced in insurance vertical in October, started ramping-up towards March, right? So even if let's say the pipeline converts, isn't it too late to meet the hurdle rate that you have for your guidance?"", ""Moderator: Mr. Saluja, may I request you to join the queue for any follow-ups?\n\nKawaljeet Saluja: Yes, thanks so much.\n\nModerator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Mukul Garg from Motilal Oswal Financial Services. Please go ahead.\n\nMukul Garg: Yes, hi! CVK, first, just a clarification on the whole discussion about guidance. You mentioned about some large deal wins. Are you factoring in a quick scale-up in these deals? And does that mean that there is a bit of a rebadging which is involved here? If not, then what is your degree of confidence that the muted environment won't push out the ramp-up, as Kawal also asked?\n\nC. Vijayakumar: Mukul, I don't want to call out the very specifics about the nature of deals but given all what we have said in the last 10, 15 minutes, we should assume that the significant part of this advanced pipeline can convert into revenue relatively quicker than what you've seen in the last two, three large deals that we've done."", ""But we have done the math, and we have done the numbers I shared and CVK shared on the pipeline are what is giving us that confidence, and the stage of the deals in the pipeline is what is making us stick with the guidance. Yes, the pipeline is one factor which we have penciled in. Things could go better, things could go worse. We obviously do a probability of timing, probability of winning, and all of those metrics that I'm sure everybody does. At this point in time, we still want to retain and we are confident, as CVK already said, that we will meet the guidance.""]","That was the commentary that I made even when we

And there is no conscious effort to reduce or change the mix. You will probably recollect that every quarter, I keep saying that we keep the customer at the center, and it is not a joke. We do keep the customer at the center. We offer products which are suitable. This quarter, we have seen a good traction for ULIP product returning. ULIP has always been a good product for us. ULIP has returned. One reason could be the market's excellent performance and our own funds excellent performance over the last five years. And this is something which people are looking at.""]","No, I don't think we have ever pushed or stopped pushing for ULIP. It is a
function of the overall market, the way people are perceiving like you would
see in the last couple of years, a lot of non-par guaranteed got sold. So, it
was purely a function of the experience of the last three years where you were uncertain about your income and all and the first thing that you wanted
to protect was future income.",SBI Life Insurance Company.pdf

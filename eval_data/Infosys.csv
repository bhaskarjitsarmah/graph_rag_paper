So Kawal as you know, there was a guidance of 4% to 7%. Of course, the higher end of the guidance had a larger amount of the mega deals. And the 4%, of course, was predicated a lot on the base volumes, which by default would be in quarter 1, quarter 2.

The next question is from the line of Vibhor Singhal from Nuvama Equities. Please go ahead.\n\nVibhor Singhal\n\nYeah, hi. Good evening. Thanks for taking my question. So, Salil, two questions from my side. One on the harping on the guidance part again. I mean, for long, I think, the guidance that Infosys gives is kind of seen a benchmark for the industry and a lead across for the entire sector as well. And the sharp cut that we had at this time. So just wanted to understand, the putting on hold of discretionary spend and other issues that you mentioned that caused us to lower the guidance, do you see that as a very Infosys specific thing, or do you see it more of an industry across the board that maybe other companies are not seeing it right now, they might be following suit in the next few quarters. Or is it something in the nature of our portfolio because of which you probably feel that it was cyclical?']","So, the discussion on the guidance is sort of similar. We have seen many of these large and mega deal wins
really give us much more confidence in the way clients are working with us, especially on cost efficiency, even
with financial services, when we announce on transformation and also consolidation. However, there have
been delays in the start of some of these programs and the decision-making in those.
Coupled with that, we have also seen some of the volume during the quarter coming down because of clients
in the industries that I mentioned, so financial services, asset management, payments, mortgages, telco, etc.,
in those specific industries, reducing their volume of work. And those two things have combined for reducing
the guidance.",Infosys.pdf
"I had one more question on your deal win. You spoke about the $2 bn deal win. Would that qualify as Infosys'
biggest win that could potentially surpass Daimler?","The $2 billion deal win mentioned by Salil Parekh could potentially qualify as Infosys' biggest win, possibly surpassing the Daimler deal.","['Okay, thank you for that context, Salil. I will drop back in the queue.\n\nModerator\n\nThank you. The next question is from the line of Abhishek Bhandari from Nomura. Please go ahead.\n\nAbhishek Bhandari\n\nYeah. Thank you. I have two questions. First of all, Salil, congrats to you for this $2 bn mega deal. And if you could share some more details around this project given that it is probably the largest you announced anywhere globally. Is it pure services deal? Or there is an element of any hardware purchase along with it? And do you think this will get into revenue translation more in the second half of this year?\n\nSalil Parekh\n\nSo thanks for the question. On this specific deal, what we have shared in the public domain is as per the filing with the stock exchange. It really focuses on work that we are doing related to AI and automation-led development, modernization and maintenance services. We do not have anything more to add to that comment.\n\nAbhishek Bhandari', 'Salil Parekh\n\nSo there, it is a combination, as you pointed out, of the environment in terms of the discretionary or transformational projects in the quarter. And then some of the mega deals and large deals, we saw a delay in decision-making in closing and also delay or changes in the start time or ramp-up of the profile of that deal. We have actually not seen any change in the win rate. And in fact, internally, we had a good win rate in Q1, and we continue to see good traction, whether it is consolidation, cost efficiency on the win rate side.\n\nAnkur Rudra\n\nAppreciate that. Just one clarification, if you could. I know this $2 bn framework agreement that you referenced is the second large deal. Could you clarify if this is fully contracted? And is this type of deal historically also been disclosed in your TCV’s over the last few quarters or years?\n\nSalil Parekh', ""Salil Parekh\n\nThis deal, while we have first made the announcement, and I'm sure you have seen, we have completed the contract signing of the deal, that is when the deal was announced. These types of deals were also included in the past within our large deal mix. Of course, in the past, there was no requirement of disclosing the specific values.\n\nAnkur Rudra\n\nOkay. Understood. Last question if I can. On margins, they were obviously flattish this time, it seemed like you have done well given what the growth has been. The five-point margin maximization plan you have highlighted, is this you playing offense or defense on margins? In other words, is Infosys confident of potentially expanding margins in F '24? Or is it more for margin defense because growth outlook does not look very strong, at least at the lower end of guide?\n\nNilanjan Roy"", 'Salil Parekh\n\nSo there, we have already announced two mega deals, which is a positive. We have large and mega deals in the pipeline. The way we have seen it is really the two points you mentioned, which is the volume discretionary work in quarter and the delay in the start of the realization, transition of some of the large and mega deals, those are what have translated to the change in the guidance.\n\nApurva Prasad\n\nAny way that you could split those factors, how much of an impact would that have been?\n\nSalil Parekh\n\nWe will not be in a position to quantify that further between those two, unfortunately.\n\nApurva Prasad\n\nSo   okay.    And     just  how     would    you    characterize      the   business      environment       and  your  client conversations at the end of the quarter as compared to how it was at the beginning of the quarter?\n\nSalil Parekh']","So first, we are now sharing the deal value making sure that that is aligned to the regulations that are there.

"The sector itself is going through a lot of people challenges, you
know, deferments of hikes and increments. So, if you can please clarify, what is the kind of hikes that you plan
to roll out this year?","The company is focusing on increasing utilization rates and reducing total headcount numbers, which provides room for further utilization increase.","['As you know, if you have to meet the year, quarter 1 and quarter 2 are very critical for that really to happen. So fundamentally, that is the base reason. As we exit the year, of course, at the higher end, there was the impact of mega deals and our guidance on both ends have come down. And one more reason is that the top-end has come down is also largely also due to the delay in mega deals signing and the transition time. But the pipeline, as Salil said is very healthy. We got two deals under the belt, and we are as confident as we exit the year.\n\nKawaljeet Saluja', 'Also with a mix from geography between Europe, Asia Pacific, and US, when you break it down into specific sub-industry areas, when you look at asset management, when you look at investment banking, when you look at payments or mortgages, those are the ones where we are seeing the impact.\n\nOur sense is, generally our clients are not spending on those projects.

And my follow-up is about an article that came out this week in the local media in India, suggesting that there is an uptick in demand for lateral hires in the industry. And these hires will probably start happening in the month of October and on. Does that make sense to you versus what you are seeing out there in terms of demand and pipeline and the ramp up, that is kind of, as you said, it is going slower than expected?\n\nSalil Parekh\n\nSo for that, my sense is, again, some of the comments you might have heard earlier from Nilanjan, our utilization has gone up. Our total headcount number is reduced, and we believe, we have some headroom for the utilization to go up further. So that would be the context in which we are operating.\n\nMoshe Katri\n\nUnderstood.

"Short term, are you seeing more, the nature of the deals becoming more short term, ROI, cost takeout?","Short term, the nature of the deals is becoming more focused on ROI, cost takeout, efficiency, and consolidation rather than on digital transformation projects or discretionary programs.","['So can you share the impact on overall TCV? Or is that something, which you would kind of start reassessing simply because it is giving a misleading picture, when you look at only the large deals wins?\n\nSalil Parekh\n\nSo there are some distinctions, what we are seeing in the large deals, mega deals, wins in the pipeline and what is more recent in the past quarters is more on cost or efficiency or consolidation. And so that work is continuing.\n\nWhat we referenced on the slowdown is more on discretionary projects, which are projects or transformation projects, which are from before, which could have been paused or slowed down by the client, and specifically in the industries, where we referenced the impact. Those are the ones, we are seeing. So they are not, in a sense, correlated with the large deals that we are looking at today.\n\nMukul Garg', 'Also with a mix from geography between Europe, Asia Pacific, and US, when you break it down into specific sub-industry areas, when you look at asset management, when you look at investment banking, when you look at payments or mortgages, those are the ones where we are seeing the impact.\n\nOur sense is, generally our clients are not spending on those projects.

We see good traction for mega deals and our large deals. The focus is much more when you are talking to clients on efficiency or cost or consolidation. We have a real traction with them. We see less discussions on digital transformation.\n---\nAnd then in general, across the client base for those industries that I referenced in the opening remark, we see where there are discretionary programs where the client feels that they can slow them or pause them for some time, we see that action. So those are the two sort of actions we are seeing. Very good traction, in fact, on the large and mega deals.\n\nModerator\n\nApurva, does that answer your question?\n\nApurva Prasad\n\nYes, thanks.\n\nModerator\n\nThank you. The next question is from the line of Kumar Rakesh from BNP Paribas Please go ahead.\n\nKumar Rakesh', 'Salil Parekh\n\nSo there, Ankur, the way we have seen it is, there will be no difference in the pattern at the beginning or the end of the quarter. It is more focused on the industry that we referenced in our opening remarks between Nilanjan and me. We have seen in different places the discretionary work and some transformation work, where it has either slowed or stopped based on different industries.\n\nAnkur Rudra\n\nOkay. And also, I just want to get a sense of maybe asking this in a slightly different way. Obviously, the guidance change is quite drastic. Is this just the change in environment of spending over the course of the last three months? Or is this also a difference in the way you measure the likelihood of\n---\nSuccess of when the deals ramp-up, or the win rate of future deals?

meaning short projects like that. But those are the types of deals we are seeing which is more focused on the
efficiency as opposed to transformation.",Infosys.pdf
"So, Salil, you were talking about the fall in volumes across the portfolio. So, what
exactly is the reason for this fall in volume?","The fall in volumes across the portfolio is mainly due to client-specific weaknesses, particularly in Europe, with more resilience seen in US-based clients. It is noted that the decline is more related to discretionary programs that can be pulled back, rather than a significant drop-off in overall volume.","['Kumar Rakesh\n\nThanks for that. My last question was around the volume commentary which you gave. So last quarter in April when we had the discussion. You had talked about that volume through the quarter, you were seeing signs of improvement. However, in this quarter, you have seen performing much below your expectation. So which are specific pockets you are seeing the weakness specifically? Is it more client specific or the entire industry working a much sharper weakness?\n\nNilanjan Roy\n\nIt is a client-specific, like this time iIn fact, we saw slightly more resilience in the US-based clients. Europe turned out to be slightly weaker. So it is very client specific actually across. I mean, it is sort of a leaking bucket in a number of clients. There is no large drop-off.

You know, my first question is the fact that in the prepared remarks, both Nilanjan and Salil, both of you mentioned that the guidance cut is partly due to a delay in volumes or the delay in timing of mega deals.

Salil, just wanted to kind of probe a bit further on the change in the guidance, and I'm just focusing on the lower end of your previous guidance.

We also see some impact in the hitech industry and in parts of retail.', 'In retail, cost efficiency and consolidation continues to remain top priority for our clients. There is intense focus on leveraging AI to accelerate digital transformation for enhanced customer and employee experience, predictive analytics and real-time insights. While decision cycles are long, large deal pipelines remain healthy in infra, apps and process modernization, cloud and workload migration.\n\nCommunication sector is witnessing continued impact from budget cuts, delayed decision making for newer spend and slow ramp-up. Growth challenges for the clients persist due to increasing opex pressures. Cost optimization and vendor consolidation are top priority for clients who are open to innovative solutions and are asking for AI to amplify productivity. OEM clients are showing greater interest in revenue-generating services, decreased time to market, increased product quality and improved customer experience. Large deal pipeline in this vertical remains very healthy.', 'Salil Parekh\n\nSo there, we have a view with our portfolio. There is a portfolio of services that works well with our clients. We absolutely have the intensity in the client environment with a large and mega deal wins to be back into the growth mode that we have been in for the last several years.\n\nWe also have a high base for comps. Q1 of last year was a 21% growth year-on-year, in the previous year, whereas the environment of other peers were not there. So all of those factors coming into play, we are very much of the view that, we have what we need, and we are continuing to go into new areas, like, generative AI or continued investments in cloud to build out, what we want, what our clients are looking for, to continue with the growth situation.\n\nPrashant Kothari', 'Our large deal value for Q1 was $2.3 bn, 56% of this was net new. We had one mega deal win in Q1. Our value of deals of financial services was 50% of the overall large deal value in Q1. We announced a mega deal of $2 bn value after the close of Q1 and before our results, before today. With a strong large deal and mega deal wins, we are building well for the future. Our pipeline of large deals is strong and we continue to have megadeals in our pipeline.\n---\nWe are delighted that Topaz, our AI and generative AI platform is resonating well with our clients. We are working on 80 generative AI projects for our clients at this time. The work we are doing encompasses large language models for software development, text, document, voice and video.']","However, AI or Generative AI is really transformative, and it is something that is changing everything
that is going on. For example, we are doing work, which is related to software development, which is related
to new code enhancements, migration, maintenance that covers the spectrum of the work that we do. And it is
also related to other areas, for example, voice, video, text. These are areas where we do work, which is
expanding the type of work we are doing. So, my sense is Generative AI is really going to transform everything
that is happening within our portfolio.",Infosys.pdf
"You said, there are some softeners in verticals like BFSI, hitech. So, will this
continue, or will it be better going forward in H2?","The softness in verticals like BFSI and hi-tech is currently attributed to the macro environment. As the macro factors are considered temporary, there is a possibility that the situation may improve going forward in the second half of the year.","['# Nilanjan Roy\n\nSo we look at this holistically. And we do not look at just one quarter and decide these decisions. We are looking at the overall environment and attrition, etc, and that is a decision we collectively take. It is just not on a quarter-to-quarter basis.\n\nWe have enough headroom in our utilization to grow volumes. And therefore, the attrition, which we see is not entirely replaced by lateral hiring. A part of that happens through lateral hiring, and we continue to re-skill and move up our fresher bench and rotate people through projects. So that benefit, we continue to get.\n\nAnd like I said, the 70 bps benefit, which we are seeing is coming partly because of improved utilization.\n---\nNitin Padmanabhan\n\nSure. And lastly, the $2.1 bn deal that we announced, in which vertical is that? If you could clarify that would be helpful?\n\nNilanjan Roy\n\nNo, we do not mention that on what vertical it is.\n\nNitin Padmanabhan\n\nOkay, sir. Thank you so much all the very best.\n\nNilanjan Roy\n\nThank you.\n\nModerator', '16\n---\nFinancial Services and the sub-segments there in telco, in some parts of retail, those being impacted in Europe as well, and we will see how that plays out into the future.\n\nMoshe Katri\n\nOkay. And my follow-up is about an article that came out this week in the local media in India, suggesting that there is an uptick in demand for lateral hires in the industry. And these hires will probably start happening in the month of October and on. Does that make sense to you versus what you are seeing out there in terms of demand and pipeline and the ramp up, that is kind of, as you said, it is going slower than expected?\n\nSalil Parekh\n\nSo for that, my sense is, again, some of the comments you might have heard earlier from Nilanjan, our utilization has gone up. Our total headcount number is reduced, and we believe, we have some headroom for the utilization to go up further. So that would be the context in which we are operating.\n\nMoshe Katri\n\nUnderstood. Thanks for the color.\n\nModerator', 'Salil Parekh\n\nSo here, what we have seen is, again, in the industries, we referenced before, whether it is financial services or telco or hi-tech, the clients or the industries are going through a difficult environment themselves in the macro. They are looking for help or support from their partners like us, where they put some projects, which they perceive to be not immediately relevant for them on a pause or slowing. Those are the discretionary works that slow down. And we will see as the environment changes, what happens there.\n\nVibhor Singhal\n\nGot it. Great. Thanks for taking my question. And wish you all the best for the rest of the year.\n\nModerator\n\nThank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that would be our last question for today. I now hand the conference back to the management for their closing remarks. Thank you, and over to you.\n\n24\n---\nSalil Parekh', 'Kumar Rakesh\n\nThanks for that.\n\nModerator\n\nThank you. The next question is from the line of James Friedman from Susquehanna. Please go ahead.\n\nJames Friedman\n\nHi, thank you. Salil, I think many investors are wondering, so I appreciate your thoughts. Does it seem to you that the soft demand was primarily due to macro factors, which are presumably temporary? Or is it potentially something more profound like perhaps related to the relevance of services or mindshare? So is this just macro it is going to go away, or is it a question of services in itself?\n\nSalil Parekh\n\nSo this is Salil. Thanks for the question. The way we see it today, we see this demand environment, especially on discretionary, that we have been discussing so far, as a function of the macro environment. We can see, for example, if you look at different industries, manufacturing growing at\n---\n21%, other industry is doing well, whereas financial service is weaker. So our service portfolio, we believe, works well.']","So there, on the first part, what we look at is, what we see within our portfolio on a daily, weekly, monthly basis.
It is, from our perspective, not something we look at as to when something will stop or not stop. We have within
our portfolio, work that we can do on digital transformation, cloud, Generative AI, which are really growth drivers
in the market. When clients or industries are looking at that we are ready with that, and we have that as one
of our growth engines.",Infosys.pdf
